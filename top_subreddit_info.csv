* You learn something new every day; what did *you* learn today?
 
* Submit interesting and **specific facts** that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not [/r/wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)).
 
#Posting rules#
 
1. **Submissions must be verifiable**. *Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title.* **Images alone do not count as valid references.** Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).
 
1. **No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements** (e.g ""TIL xyz is a great movie"").

1. **No recent sources.** Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) with a publication date more recent than two months are not allowed.
 
1. No soapboxing or agenda based submissions. This includes (but is not limited to) submissions related to: 
   1. Recent political issues and politicians
   1. Social and economic issues
   1. Environmental issues
 
1. **No misleading claims**. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.
 
1. *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*
   1. Titles **must** begin with ""TIL ...""
   1. Make them **descriptive, concise and specific** (e.g. not ""TIL something interesting about bacon"").
   1. Titles must be able to **stand on their own** without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.
   1. *""TIL about ..."" and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word ""about"").*
   1. *""TIL how to ..."" posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**
1. No submissions related to the usage, existence or features of specific software/websites (e.g. ""TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22"").
1.  **All NSFW links must be tagged** *(including comments).*
####  *Please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index) for more detailed explanations of the rules.*

[Previous subs of the month] (https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/subofthemonthlist)

# Rules
*hover for details*

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. As the minimum age for Reddit access is [13 years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/7h5xr7/is_there_a_age_limit_for_reddit/dqodxmb), posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed.|
|2. No memes, and no HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, or DAE posts.|If your submission begins with ""When you…"" or ""When they…"" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, ""challenges,"" or elements thereof. Non-memetic image macros are allowed.
|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [KarmaDecay](http://www.karmadecay.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|
|4. No personal info, no hate speech, no harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|
|5. No politics.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|
|6. No forbidden titles. (See below.)|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as ""I got banned from \/r/\_\_\_"" or ""This got removed from \/r/\_\_\_"" are not allowed. Emoji-based titles, memetic titles, and titles meant to circumvent any other rules are also forbidden.|
|7. No gore, pornography, or sexually graphic images.|Try /r/NSFWfunny. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|
|8. Do not rehost or hotlink webcomics.|If you are not the author of the comic in question, you may only submit links to the page where it is hosted. Webcomic authors may [request verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/comicauthor) from the moderators, after which they may rehost their own work.|
|9. No pictures of just text.|Submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with irrelevant images that don't add context, and transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots). Make a self post instead. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/2cPuY8C.jpg)|
|10. No SMS or social media content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, or any other form of ""comments section"" on the Internet, as well as [images accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed. Please view [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) for suggestions of where these submissions can be offered.|

Please note:

* Hate speech and bigotry will be removed at the moderators' discretion.

* Bots and bot-like accounts are not allowed.

* No link shorteners (or HugeURL) in either post links or comments. They will be deleted regardless of intent. This is an anti-spam measure.

* All submissions to /r/Funny are governed by [Reddit's policies on self-promotion and spam](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

|What do I do if I see a post that breaks the rules?|Click on the report button, and [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the comments of the post.|
|What should I do if I don't see my post in the new queue?|If your submission isn't showing up, please don't just delete it as that makes the filter hate you! Instead [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the post. We'll unban it and it should get better. Please allow 10 minutes for the post to appear before messaging moderators|

[](http://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole)

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. 

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  

#[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)
___

#**Rules**

##1. Be Civil

The title of this sub is not an invitation for you to be cruel. The purpose of this space is to determine whether or not someone is in the wrong, not to tear them a new one. People post here to learn and to grow from what they learn here. Don't be an asshole when making your judgments. Treat others with respect, no matter how big of an asshole they may be.

This rule applies to everyone, whether involved in the story or not.  Don't get into prolonged internet spats that devolve into insults. Do not backseat mod - use reports.

[Click here for details on how to be civil in a sub about assholes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/becivil)

##2. Voting Rules

Upvote posts that are appropriate for this sub or that you think make for an interesting discussion. PLEASE DO NOT downvote if you think OP is an asshole, go to the comments section and call him an asshole like a civilized person.

In the comments, upvote any comment that gives the correct judgment of the situation. DO NOT downvote people for disagreeing with you or for merely commenting on their own post unless they are being abusive or argumentative.

##3. Accept Your Judgment

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun, even if it's not going well for you. People will come back to see what consensus was reached in your thread. If you erase a discussion because you don't like the way it's going, that is extremely frustrating to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

##5. No Violence

If your post references violence, don't share it here. Threads which mention violence are difficult to moderate, we have to remove all comments which encourage or incite violence. It's difficult to do this in a thread which discusses violence.

Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **This is a zero tolerance policy.** Don't even mention violence.

##6. How To Post

The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise.

##7. What Posts Belong Here?

This is the sub to lay out your actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you. Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. We do not settle Reddit or similar online drama.

Submissions should be TRUTHFUL descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts you've had or may have that need arbitration. Describe both sides in detail. Being neutral gets you more accurate feedback.

##8. Do Not Ask For Validation

Don't submit humblebrag stories where there is no chance that you are the asshole, or awfulbrag stories where you are obviously being evil.

When making a post, you should be seeking arbitration in an ambiguous situation. Threads with obvious outcomes are not interesting to our subscribers.

##9. Do Not Ask For Advice

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.

You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.

If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

##10. Meta Posts and Updates Require Permission

If you want to talk about the sub, and you hide your complaint, question, or opinion in a post that starts with AITA, you will be banned. Those are called META posts, and they must have a title that starts with META.

Please request mod approval after you submit your META post or your update post. Make sure the title of your meta post starts with META and the title of your update post starts with UPDATE. See our FAQ and full rulebook for more guidelines.

##11. No breakups/hookups

We do not allow submissions where the central conflict is your relationship and instead recommend a relationship focused sub.

The following posts are forever banned:

AITA for breaking up with _

AITA for NOT breaking up with _

AITA for sleeping with _

AITA for NOT sleeping with _

AITA for dating _

AITA for NOT dating _

AITA for doing sexual act _

AITA for NOT doing sexual act _

AITA for being attracted to _

AITA for NOT being attracted to _

Etc.

##12. Comments and Flairing

After 18 hours, the post will be assigned a flair representing the sub's judgment. The flair will be decided by the top comment of the post. OPs should expect questions and should answer them within the 18 hour period.

If you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.

**YTA** = You're the Asshole; 

**NTA** = Not the A-hole; 

**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
 
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 

**INFO** = Not Enough Info 

##13. User Flairs

We award flairs for community members who distinguish themselves in their mastery of asshole judgment. If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our full rulebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index).

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.
