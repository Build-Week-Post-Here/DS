[Previous subs of the month] (https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/subofthemonthlist)

# Rules
*hover for details*

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. As the minimum age for Reddit access is [13 years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/7h5xr7/is_there_a_age_limit_for_reddit/dqodxmb), posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed.|
|2. No memes, and no HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, or DAE posts.|If your submission begins with ""When you…"" or ""When they…"" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, ""challenges,"" or elements thereof. Non-memetic image macros are allowed.
|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [KarmaDecay](http://www.karmadecay.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|
|4. No personal info, no hate speech, no harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|
|5. No politics.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|
|6. No forbidden titles. (See below.)|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as ""I got banned from \/r/\_\_\_"" or ""This got removed from \/r/\_\_\_"" are not allowed. Emoji-based titles, memetic titles, and titles meant to circumvent any other rules are also forbidden.|
|7. No gore, pornography, or sexually graphic images.|Try /r/NSFWfunny. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|
|8. Do not rehost or hotlink webcomics.|If you are not the author of the comic in question, you may only submit links to the page where it is hosted. Webcomic authors may [request verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/comicauthor) from the moderators, after which they may rehost their own work.|
|9. No pictures of just text.|Submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with irrelevant images that don't add context, and transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots). Make a self post instead. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/2cPuY8C.jpg)|
|10. No SMS or social media content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, or any other form of ""comments section"" on the Internet, as well as [images accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed. Please view [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) for suggestions of where these submissions can be offered.|

Please note:

* Hate speech and bigotry will be removed at the moderators' discretion.

* Bots and bot-like accounts are not allowed.

* No link shorteners (or HugeURL) in either post links or comments. They will be deleted regardless of intent. This is an anti-spam measure.

* All submissions to /r/Funny are governed by [Reddit's policies on self-promotion and spam](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

|What do I do if I see a post that breaks the rules?|Click on the report button, and [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the comments of the post.|
|What should I do if I don't see my post in the new queue?|If your submission isn't showing up, please don't just delete it as that makes the filter hate you! Instead [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the post. We'll unban it and it should get better. Please allow 10 minutes for the post to appear before messaging moderators|

6,"**Welcome to r/AmITheAsshole!**

[](http://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole)

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. 

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  

#[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)
___

#**Rules**

##1. Be Civil

The title of this sub is not an invitation for you to be cruel. The purpose of this space is to determine whether or not someone is in the wrong, not to tear them a new one. People post here to learn and to grow from what they learn here. Don't be an asshole when making your judgments. Treat others with respect, no matter how big of an asshole they may be.

This rule applies to everyone, whether involved in the story or not.  Don't get into prolonged internet spats that devolve into insults. Do not backseat mod - use reports.

[Click here for details on how to be civil in a sub about assholes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/becivil)

##2. Voting Rules

Upvote posts that are appropriate for this sub or that you think make for an interesting discussion. PLEASE DO NOT downvote if you think OP is an asshole, go to the comments section and call him an asshole like a civilized person.

In the comments, upvote any comment that gives the correct judgment of the situation. DO NOT downvote people for disagreeing with you or for merely commenting on their own post unless they are being abusive or argumentative.

##3. Accept Your Judgment

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun, even if it's not going well for you. People will come back to see what consensus was reached in your thread. If you erase a discussion because you don't like the way it's going, that is extremely frustrating to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

##5. No Violence

If your post references violence, don't share it here. Threads which mention violence are difficult to moderate, we have to remove all comments which encourage or incite violence. It's difficult to do this in a thread which discusses violence.

Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **This is a zero tolerance policy.** Don't even mention violence.

##6. How To Post

The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise.

##7. What Posts Belong Here?

This is the sub to lay out your actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you. Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. We do not settle Reddit or similar online drama.

Submissions should be TRUTHFUL descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts you've had or may have that need arbitration. Describe both sides in detail. Being neutral gets you more accurate feedback.

##8. Do Not Ask For Validation

Don't submit humblebrag stories where there is no chance that you are the asshole, or awfulbrag stories where you are obviously being evil.

When making a post, you should be seeking arbitration in an ambiguous situation. Threads with obvious outcomes are not interesting to our subscribers.

##9. Do Not Ask For Advice

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.

You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.

If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

##10. Meta Posts and Updates Require Permission

If you want to talk about the sub, and you hide your complaint, question, or opinion in a post that starts with AITA, you will be banned. Those are called META posts, and they must have a title that starts with META.

Please request mod approval after you submit your META post or your update post. Make sure the title of your meta post starts with META and the title of your update post starts with UPDATE. See our FAQ and full rulebook for more guidelines.

##11. No breakups/hookups

We do not allow submissions where the central conflict is your relationship and instead recommend a relationship focused sub.

The following posts are forever banned:

AITA for breaking up with _

AITA for NOT breaking up with _

AITA for sleeping with _

AITA for NOT sleeping with _

AITA for dating _

AITA for NOT dating _

AITA for doing sexual act _

AITA for NOT doing sexual act _

AITA for being attracted to _

AITA for NOT being attracted to _

Etc.

##12. Comments and Flairing

After 18 hours, the post will be assigned a flair representing the sub's judgment. The flair will be decided by the top comment of the post. OPs should expect questions and should answer them within the 18 hour period.

If you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.

**YTA** = You're the Asshole; 

**NTA** = Not the A-hole; 

**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
 
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 

**INFO** = Not Enough Info 

##13. User Flairs

We award flairs for community members who distinguish themselves in their mastery of asshole judgment. If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our full rulebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index).

##About:

A subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public. Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.

>Saturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)

##Rules:

0. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.

1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage or call for witch-hunts

2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders

3. Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)

4. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban

5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]

6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.

7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.

8.  ~~Submissions from videogurr.com are banned and will be removed.~~ (This rule no longer applies, but may be re-instated in the future.)

9. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).

10. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.

[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.

#Need help with your relationship? 

######Whether it's romance, friendship, family, co-workers, or basic human interaction: we're here to help! 

##**Community Guidelines**

###I. Posting - Do These:

##### [](#h5)

####1. Request posts must **request specific advice** for how to handle a situation. 
1. If you're thinking of posting something that would be a Moral Judgment post as written out in rule II.4, try [seeking advice for what to do next instead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjq8s8/meta_new_rule_until_at_least_2019%F0%9D%91%A8%F0%9D%92%96%F0%9D%92%8806_000000/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=relationship_advice&utm_content=t5_2r0cn) 

####2. Updates can only be _posted on their own exactly once_, two days after the first post.
1. a. Rapid-fire updates (i.e. within 2 days, meaning 48 hours, of a post) _must_ instead be edited into the original request post.

2. b. Update posts must link back to the original thread. 

#### 3. Posts must include a summary title, a fleshed-out description, and a **[TL;DR](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR)** near the end. Posts _should_ also include:
1. **Genders** (Birth sex if relevant)

2. **Relationship Length**

3. **Ages** ([13+](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#UseoftheServicebyYou), though teens can always visit [TRA](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/)).

4. **[TL;DR](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR)** if your post is longer than 250ish words (about a half page).

####4. **Throwaway accounts _must_ start with `ThrowRA-`.** Examples:
1. /u/ThrowRA-mod ⁠— _This account works!_

2. /u/ThrowRAmod ⁠— _This account will **fail!**_

3. /u/underthesea77 ⁠— _This account will **fail!**_

>
>3. **General discussion topics** such as requests for stories, polls, general questions, etc.
>
>4. **Moral Judgment Posts** - See rule I(1) for what to do if your question resembles these:

>  * TIFU - ""Today I 🤬ed Up""
>  * DAE - ""Does Anyone Else?"" or ""Have You Ever?""
>
>6. **Hypotheticals,** including What-Ifs, Social Experiments, Script Treatments/Outlines/Synopses in advice-seeking form, etc. (See: /r/hypotheticalsituation)

>3. Suggestions for violence or suicide. 
>
>4. Blanket statements about a group (""All men are X"", ""All women do Y"") are not allowed. Please report them.

###V. Participation
##### [](#h5)
>1. Do report posts you see which break the rules. If you think the reason might not be obvious, feel free to add your reasoning as to why. 
>
>2. Do **not** report with posts you believe are bad advice for the OP. That's what downvotes are for.

###VI. Enforcement
##### [](#h5)
>1. Posting issues will generally result in a post removal unless an equivalent comment rule is also tripped.

**gif links cannot contain sound**

**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem.**


1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post gifs that have already appeared on /r/gifs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the gif).  **[Duration must be less than or equal to twenty (≤20) seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/RXihRpT.png)**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.

###About \/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)
* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#0. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#1. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#2. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#3. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#4. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#5. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#6. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#7. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#8. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.

###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos#mods)

#Removals & Warnings
* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.

* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*

* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. 

* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos. Failure to do so may result in a ban.
