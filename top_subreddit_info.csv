# Rules
*hover for details*

|||
|:------|:---|
|1. All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. As the minimum age for Reddit access is [13 years old](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/7h5xr7/is_there_a_age_limit_for_reddit/dqodxmb), posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed.|
|2. No memes, and no HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, or DAE posts.|If your submission begins with ""When you…"" or ""When they…"" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, ""challenges,"" or elements thereof. Non-memetic image macros are allowed.
|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [KarmaDecay](http://www.karmadecay.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|
|4. No personal info, no hate speech, no harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|
|5. No politics.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|
|6. No forbidden titles. (See below.)|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as ""I got banned from \/r/\_\_\_"" or ""This got removed from \/r/\_\_\_"" are not allowed. Emoji-based titles, memetic titles, and titles meant to circumvent any other rules are also forbidden.|
|7. No gore, pornography, or sexually graphic images.|Try /r/NSFWfunny. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|
|8. Do not rehost or hotlink webcomics.|If you are not the author of the comic in question, you may only submit links to the page where it is hosted. Webcomic authors may [request verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/comicauthor) from the moderators, after which they may rehost their own work.|
|9. No pictures of just text.|Submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with irrelevant images that don't add context, and transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots). Make a self post instead. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/2cPuY8C.jpg)|
|10. No SMS or social media content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, or any other form of ""comments section"" on the Internet, as well as [images accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed. Please view [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) for suggestions of where these submissions can be offered.|

---
Please note:

* Hate speech and bigotry will be removed at the moderators' discretion.

* Bots and bot-like accounts are not allowed.

* No link shorteners (or HugeURL) in either post links or comments. They will be deleted regardless of intent. This is an anti-spam measure.

* All submissions to /r/Funny are governed by [Reddit's policies on self-promotion and spam](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

|-|-|
|What do I do if I see a post that breaks the rules?|Click on the report button, and [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the comments of the post.|
|What should I do if I don't see my post in the new queue?|If your submission isn't showing up, please don't just delete it as that makes the filter hate you! Instead [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the post. We'll unban it and it should get better.

A community for the dumbass in all of us. We all have those moments where we do something ridiculously stupid. Share your stories and laugh along with the internet.

##Rules
##### *hover for details*

######[](#space)

> ### All titles must start with TIFU
> - **TIFU** stands for today I fucked up, which means something you did that is your fault. Just because something bad happened to you doesn't mean it's a fuck up.
> -  **TIFU** must be at the beginning of the post title or it will automatically be removed. 
> - **TIFUpdate** if you are posting a follow-up post to update us on your story. 

######[](#space)

> ### Uninspired, lacking in context, literal shitpost, overly vulgar and glorifying illegal activities posts may be removed at mods discretion
> - **Uninspired** as in something that is super common, lacking in imagination or originality.
> - **Context** as in the story doesn't have any more info beyond the title. *note*: All posts must contain at least 750 characters of meaningful content.
> - **Shitpost** as in literally involving defecation or other bodily fluids.
> - **Overly vulgar** includes obscene situations, such as, but not limited to, incest, minors, death and assault to humans and animals. Consensual situations between two, unrelated adults should be fine. Vulgar does not mean using bad words. 
> - **Illegal activities** that you glorify or giving advice on how to do something illegal.
> - **Not Your Fault** as in it was just something bad that happened to you; if it wasn't directly your fault, it wasn't your fuckup.

######[](#space)

> ### All posts must end with a TL;DR and tag NSFW when necessary 
> - **TL;DR** or too long didn't read which is a summarization of your post in a few bitesize sentence. At minimum, your TL;DR summary must contain your fuckup and its consequences. You may include additional information if you'd like. The TL;DR must be at the very end of your post.
> - **NSFW** or not safe for work. If you're not sure if it's NSFW or not, better to be safe than sorry. 

######[](#space)

> ### Be civil and don't be disruptive
> - **Be civil** means don't do these things; personal attacks, harassment,  trolling, and bigotry. Use your better judgement. 
> - **Disruptive** such as posting, or seeking, any identifying personal information (real/fake). This includes yourself or others, and refers, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, or any social media accounts. As well as brigading with either votes or comments.

######[](#space)

> ### No spam, bots or advertising
> - **Spam**, don't link to things that you may or may not be rewarded for. Posting links of you narrating a story is considered spam.
> - **Bots** are annoying and will be banned.
> - **Advertising**, we are not a platform for you (patreon or charities) or your products, seek https://www.redditinc.com/advertising instead.

6,"**Welcome to r/AmITheAsshole!**

[](http://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole)

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. 

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  

#[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)
___

#**Rules**

##1. Be Civil

The title of this sub is not an invitation for you to be cruel. The purpose of this space is to determine whether or not someone is in the wrong, not to tear them a new one. People post here to learn and to grow from what they learn here. Don't be an asshole when making your judgments. Treat others with respect, no matter how big of an asshole they may be.

This rule applies to everyone, whether involved in the story or not.  Don't get into prolonged internet spats that devolve into insults. Do not backseat mod - use reports.

[Click here for details on how to be civil in a sub about assholes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/becivil)

##2. Voting Rules

Upvote posts that are appropriate for this sub or that you think make for an interesting discussion. PLEASE DO NOT downvote if you think OP is an asshole, go to the comments section and call him an asshole like a civilized person.

In the comments, upvote any comment that gives the correct judgment of the situation. DO NOT downvote people for disagreeing with you or for merely commenting on their own post unless they are being abusive or argumentative.

##3. Accept Your Judgment

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun, even if it's not going well for you. People will come back to see what consensus was reached in your thread. If you erase a discussion because you don't like the way it's going, that is extremely frustrating to everyone who has taken an interest in the topic. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

##5. No Violence

If your post references violence, don't share it here. Threads which mention violence are difficult to moderate, we have to remove all comments which encourage or incite violence. It's difficult to do this in a thread which discusses violence.

Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **This is a zero tolerance policy.** Don't even mention violence.

##6. How To Post

The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise.

##7. What Posts Belong Here?

This is the sub to lay out your actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you. Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should be truthful and reflect real situations. That means no shitposts, parody, or satire. We do not settle Reddit or similar online drama.

Submissions should be TRUTHFUL descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts you've had or may have that need arbitration. Describe both sides in detail. Being neutral gets you more accurate feedback.

##8. Do Not Ask For Validation

Don't submit humblebrag stories where there is no chance that you are the asshole, or awfulbrag stories where you are obviously being evil.

When making a post, you should be seeking arbitration in an ambiguous situation. Threads with obvious outcomes are not interesting to our subscribers.

##9. Do Not Ask For Advice

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.

You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.

If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

##10. Meta Posts and Updates Require Permission

If you want to talk about the sub, and you hide your complaint, question, or opinion in a post that starts with AITA, you will be banned. Those are called META posts, and they must have a title that starts with META.

Please request mod approval after you submit your META post or your update post. Make sure the title of your meta post starts with META and the title of your update post starts with UPDATE. See our FAQ and full rulebook for more guidelines.

##11. No breakups/hookups

We do not allow submissions where the central conflict is your relationship and instead recommend a relationship focused sub.

The following posts are forever banned:

AITA for breaking up with _

AITA for NOT breaking up with _

AITA for sleeping with _

AITA for NOT sleeping with _

AITA for dating _

AITA for NOT dating _

AITA for doing sexual act _

AITA for NOT doing sexual act _

AITA for being attracted to _

AITA for NOT being attracted to _

Etc.

##12. Comments and Flairing

After 18 hours, the post will be assigned a flair representing the sub's judgment. The flair will be decided by the top comment of the post. OPs should expect questions and should answer them within the 18 hour period.

If you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.

**YTA** = You're the Asshole; 

**NTA** = Not the A-hole; 

**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
 
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 

**INFO** = Not Enough Info 

##13. User Flairs

We award flairs for community members who distinguish themselves in their mastery of asshole judgment. If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our full rulebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index).

##About:

A subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public. Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.

>Saturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)

##Rules:

0. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.

1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage or call for witch-hunts

2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders

3. Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)

4. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban

5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]

6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.

7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.

8.  ~~Submissions from videogurr.com are banned and will be removed.~~ (This rule no longer applies, but may be re-instated in the future.)

9. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).

10. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.

[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.

#Need help with your relationship? 

######Whether it's romance, friendship, family, co-workers, or basic human interaction: we're here to help! 

##**Community Guidelines**

###I. Posting - Do These:

##### [](#h5)

####1. Request posts must **request specific advice** for how to handle a situation. 
1. If you're thinking of posting something that would be a Moral Judgment post as written out in rule II.4, try [seeking advice for what to do next instead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjq8s8/meta_new_rule_until_at_least_2019%F0%9D%91%A8%F0%9D%92%96%F0%9D%92%8806_000000/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=relationship_advice&utm_content=t5_2r0cn) 

####2. Updates can only be _posted on their own exactly once_, two days after the first post.
1. a. Rapid-fire updates (i.e. within 2 days, meaning 48 hours, of a post) _must_ instead be edited into the original request post.

2. b. Update posts must link back to the original thread. 

#### 3. Posts must include a summary title, a fleshed-out description, and a **[TL;DR](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR)** near the end. Posts _should_ also include:
1. **Genders** (Birth sex if relevant)

2. **Relationship Length**

3. **Ages** ([13+](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#UseoftheServicebyYou), though teens can always visit [TRA](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/)).

4. **[TL;DR](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR)** if your post is longer than 250ish words (about a half page).

####4. **Throwaway accounts _must_ start with `ThrowRA-`.** Examples:
1. /u/ThrowRA-mod ⁠— _This account works!_

2. /u/ThrowRAmod ⁠— _This account will **fail!**_

3. /u/underthesea77 ⁠— _This account will **fail!**_

###II Posting - **Not These**:

>
>2. **Unsolicited Advice** (see: /r/self)
>
>3. **General discussion topics** such as requests for stories, polls, general questions, etc.
>
>4. **Moral Judgment Posts** - See rule I(1) for what to do if your question resembles these:

>  * TIFU - ""Today I 🤬ed Up""
>  * DAE - ""Does Anyone Else?"" or ""Have You Ever?""
>
>6. **Hypotheticals,** including What-Ifs, Social Experiments, Script Treatments/Outlines/Synopses in advice-seeking form, etc. (See: /r/hypotheticalsituation)

**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem.**


1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post gifs that have already appeared on /r/gifs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

 **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the gif).  **[Duration must be less than or equal to twenty (≤20) seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/RXihRpT.png)**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/gifs.

#Featured Sub » /r/CuriousVideos

---
###About \/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)
* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#0. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#1. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#2. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#3. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#4. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#5. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#6. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#7. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#8. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.

#Removals & Warnings
* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking).

* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. 

* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos. Failure to do so may result in a ban.

23,"Welcome to /r/Jokes!

**Guidelines and Information**

- Offensive jokes are fine as long as they are still jokes. We do make exceptions for extremely offensive jokes.
- Keep the comment section civil and light hearted.
- Personal attacks will not be tolerated. If you want to be a dick, go to /r/insults 
- Jokes must be in text format, no emoji's or linking allowed. (YouTube, Imgur, etc)
- As a measure to prevent spam and reposts we are limiting the number of jokes a user can submit to 3 every 24 hours.
- This subreddit is not a platform for blatant self-promotion
- If you post a NSFW image/link in the comments, it must be tagged as NSFW (Nudity/gross images) or NSFL (Gore/extremely disturbing images, and only if relevant to the conversation)
- Jokes must be in English


These are jokes. Some of them are old, and as such reflect the tone of the times. Some of them are new, and just as offensive. Unless it's spam, it stays.

**If you find certain comments or submissions here offensive, the best way to address it is with more speech.**

24,"A place to post social media screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

##**Rules:**

1. Take a screenshot and completely **redact all information that can be used to identify a person**. This includes, but is not limited to: first and last names, usernames (including your own, including the symbol which identifies a commenter as you, including any other people featured in the image, including public accounts), subreddit and online community names, titles of specific posts, and other information like addresses, phone numbers, and license plates.  If you intentionally post personal information, you will be banned. This is to prevent brigading and harassment, so we take this rule very seriously.  
**Do not ask for personal information, suggest someone should be doxxed, link to or comment with personal information, openly solicit personal information, or contact the people featured here. Don't even wax poetic about wanting to post identifying information. You will be banned.**

2. **Do not encourage, glorify, or incite violence.**  
For example: ""Kill yourself"", ""It wouldn't be so bad if we killed all the pedophiles"", ""This guy needs to die"", ""I hope this guy gets stabbed to death with a rusty screwdriver"", etc. 

3. **Must be a total piece of shit**  
A total piece of shit is someone who is intentionally harming people or animals. Bad parking, annoying but harmless things, memes & image macros, trophy hunters, people who put down their pets humanely, short & unoriginal comments, overly political/partisan posts, screenshots of someone's Reddit profile, petty arguments, fights/simple revenge, and common/unoriginal crimes do not belong here. Anti-vaxxer posts rarely belong here.  If your post isn't shitty enough, it'll be removed.  
**If you post a picture with the backstory in the title, no story in the image, or the face of a public figure with no story, you will be banned.  This isn't punchablefaces.**

4. **Avoid reposting**.  If you see a repost, report it, preferably with a link to the previous post.  

5. **No news articles. Images, screenshots, text-posts, & gifs only.** Reddit's native hosting and https://imgur.com/upload are preferred.  Please take a screenshot of the article, preferably the title plus a paragraph or two, or link the video through imgur or v.redd.it.  **Screenshots of the headline only will be removed.**  This is because no one reads articles, even in article subreddits; articles rarely get more than 50 upvotes here, and articles inherently include personal info for somebody, which is not allowed in any form about any person.  

6. **No posts featuring gore or child abuse.** Posts featuring gore/child abuse are not allowed here.

---
**Do not report users through modmail**, use the report button with a custom reason.  The only exception is for reporting people who are actually doxxing or other immediate threats.  Do not report people for being mean to you, arguing, or making comments which you disagree with.  If you abuse the report button or modmail, you will be banned.  **If you ask for someone who follows the rules to be banned, you may be banned.**

Posts with bad titles will be automatically removed, you can then resubmit with a better title.  No, you cannot edit your post title or image once it's been created, and neither can the mods.

**RULES**. |              
:--|:--                                  
 I: Follow reddit's standards!|
 II: No hate speech! There is a difference between comedy and outright hate speech, but ironic hate speech is still hate speech. Know the difference or get banned! Posts in question shall be reviewed by the mods. No memes about violent tragedies or anything that could be seen as glorifying violence. Absolutely no school shooter memes. Posts or comments that can be seen as glorifying violence will result in a ban. This also includes (but is not limited to) memes regarding: Deaths, terrorist attacks, rape, sexual assault, pedo, murder, war, bombings, and school shootings. Breaking this rule may result in a permanent ban. We have zero tolerance for this behavior.  |
 III: Don't be a dick! This includes spoilers, don't post spoilers or you will be banned |
 IV: Flair your posts accordingly after submitting them. |
 V: Censor any and all personal information from posts and comments, or it will be removed. Real or fake! Yours or others! Just don't do it.|
 VI: No spam, outside links, or videos. r/dankmemes is strictly for memes. Post videos (or anything using v.redd.it) to r/dankvideos. Gifs must be well under 10 seconds long. **This is not a platform to advertise your social media network or subreddit.** If you can't grow it organically, it probably isn't very good anyway. Linking to your instagram or twitter, or spamming links with it watermarked can result in a ban // **No queue flooding - Limit yourself to 5 posts per day** |  
 VII: Do not bait or prime the user to interact with your meme or profile. This includes, but is not limited to, asking for votes/comments/awards in the meme or title, implying that your post will/won’t make it out of new, pandering to users sorting by new/scrolling by, mentioning cakeday, petitions, etc. |
 VIII: Do not encourage or participate in brigading of any subreddits or of any users of Reddit or elsewhere, in any way, shape, or form! This is very against Reddit rules; action will be taken. | 
 IX: Keep it dank! This sub is for humor (and the dankest of memes)! | 
 X: If a post has graphic content, flair it as NSFW, else it will be removed! | 
 XI: NO REEEEEEE-POSTS! This isn't Instagram! Don't steal memes from elsewhere! **If you didn't make it, don't post it!** (Chain posts and posts which you have already submitted here are also banned). | 
 XII: Don't be a normie. If you post normie trash you could be banned! This includes, but is not limited to, Impact font (and fonts which look like Impact), minions, advice animals, rage comics, and the B emoji.|
 XIII: Format your meme correctly. No posts where the title is the meme caption. The caption *must* be in the meme image, not in the submission title. (Basically, if the image makes sense to us by itself, it's fine. If the image requires the submission title for it to have any chance of making sense, we remove it.) |
 XIV: Direct links only! No albums or landing pages. |
 XV: No Political shills! r/dankmemes is for dank memes, and is not a political campaign ground. Absurd memes about politicians are cool, but attempting to push a narrative or anything like that will result in a ban! |

**We reserve the right to remove posts and potentially ban for any reason**

[](#header)

**Does your post qualify for /r/MildlyInteresting? Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**

-----
> ### 1. No memes 
> This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. ""banana for scale,"" ""potato quality"").

----- 

> ### 2. No related posts
> Posts that acknowledge, ""one-up,"" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. ""I see your X and raise you Y"")

-----

> ###3. No x-posts or reposts
> Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.

> **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. 

----- 

> ###4. Original [OC] photographs only
> **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  

> **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  

> **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.

> **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.

-----

> ###5. No screenshots

> No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. 

-----

> ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content
> **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  

> **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a ""spoiler"" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!

> **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )

Before posting [consult our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/9jk7v8/what_makes_an_insaneparent_faq/) or [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/wiki/content).

**Rules:**

1. No identifying information.
     * Do not link directly to social 
        media accounts. NO MATTER WHAT.
     * Verified accounts do not need 
           to be blocked out. They are 
           public figures.

2. Please submit links to actual news stories. While screenshots are allowed ensure you provide the source article in the comments. If you do not **your post is subject to removal**. This is to ensure misinformation is not spread.

3.  No direct links or screenshots to reddit posts or comments.
     * This rule is here to prevent Vote Brigading in other 
       subreddits or harassment of other users. If you see 
      a relevant story or post on reddit it is okay to share it here - 
      we recommend you use [archive.org](https://www.archive.org) 
      for linking a thread to post here. Do not link threads directly. 

4. We ask that you also flair your post to make it searchable. 
    * Automods flairing is not perfect. Please 
       ensure the flair fits the subject of your post.

5. Accounts believed to be spam accounts will be permabanned. 
     * Examples of this include a new

6. [Be excellent to each other.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXsMqXLBh_w) 
     * This is a place for civil 
           discussion. Dissenting 
           opinions are allowed; 
           however, keep things 
           civil. If a conversation 
           breaks down into insults 
           and ad hom - this rule 
           becomes relevant. 

7. No fake posts. 
    * If your post is confirmed 
      to be fake you are subject
      to a permanent ban. 
      You have been warned. 
      **Non-serious posts are, obviously, not subject 
      to this rule.**

8. No posts that have been posted in the last 2 months, [common reposts](https://imgur.com/a/1RF5ez2), or posts currently in the top 25 posts of all time.
    * This is also here to prevent lazy karma farming / karma whoring.

9. No medical or legal advice.
    * This sub will not be party to teens giving other teens shitty medical or legal advice; nor, will we be a place that gives anti-vaxxers a platform to spread misinformation.

10. No Memes outside meme monday.
     * Memes are an important part of any community and the use of them to express a free range of emotions is important; however, we want the community to be more focused. We, after community feedback, feel a designated day for them would work better.

**Content guidelines:**

1. Social media posts and news articles are fair game.

2. If your post contains graphic descriptions of abuse, please attach an appropriate warning - either by marking it NSFW or indicating so in the title. [There is also a page on our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/wiki/reporting_abuse) with steps to help you report abuse to the proper authorities. 

3. Non-Serious posts **must** be properly flaired.
    * Quora, Yahoo Answers, Reddit, and Review-esque posts are banned.
    * Memes only on Mondays

4. Posts *may be* removed at a moderators discretion. If we feel a post **does not fit** in the box of insane parents - it will be removed. We are driving at quality over quantity.  

5. If you have any further questions - please consult [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/wiki/content).

Black culture has a unique way of examining the everyday and we are here to showcase that.

**☑️ Country Club**

**[What is BPT Country Club and how do I get verified?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/bfqeee/bpt_country_club_threads/)**

---
☑️
RULES

1.) **Do not post content just because a black person posted it.** This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious and insightful social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people.

-    1. **No original content.** We encourage users to go on twitter to find tweets as opposed to making tweets just  for     this subreddit.
  


2.) No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/).
 
3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 
 
4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.
 
5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).

6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.

7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.

8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add ""bruh"", ""fam"", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.

9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking ""what does x mean?"" will be removed. 


10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.
 
11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  

12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**

31,"## About

A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.

""Showerthought"" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane.

Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. 

**Please read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) before submitting.**

**Please read [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq) before messaging the moderators.**

## Rules  

- **All content must be original and unique.**    
Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on Reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_all_content_must_be_original_and_unique.)

- **All posts must be showerthoughts.**     
For an explanation of what a showerthought actually is (and is not), please read [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview).

- **Your entire thought must be in the title.**     
You may include examples, explanations, or further information in the body section, but all posts to /r/Showerthoughts must stand on their own as nothing but a title.

- **No shower ""observations.""**    
Thoughts directly related to being in the shower (or anything related to the bathroom) will be removed. [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22shower_observations..22)

- **No jokes, puns, or wordplay.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.22wordplay.3F.22)

- **No ""life pro-tips"" or advice.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22life_pro-tips.22_or_advice.)

- **No posts about Reddit or its functions.**    
Thoughts pertaining to or mentioning Reddit are not allowed.[»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_commentaries_on_reddit_or_its_functions.)

- **No posts relating to politics, social justice, or religion.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_no_posts_relating_to_politics.2C_religion.2C_or_social_justice.)

- **Don't be a jerk.** [»](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules#wiki_don.27t_be_a_jerk.)

> [**Please see the complete rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules)

> Exceedingly nonsensical or common thoughts will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, as will thoughts that are poorly written, overly vulgar, or obscene.

> **This subreddit is moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low-quality, low-effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not ""[let the votes decide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F)."" We understand this type of policy is controversial and uncommon (especially for a high-traffic subreddit), but we believe it gives /r/Showerthoughts the best chance at maintaining quality.

33,"###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!
Here you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).
####What does ""Oddly Satisfying"" mean?
We are forever searching for a ""true definition"". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* ""oddly satisfying"" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.

***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**

######Rules:
**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**
###1)  **Banned Topics:**
We have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:

* **Memes or image macros**

* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as ""2048"", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.

* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).

* **Compilation Albums/Videos**
  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**
  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).
  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.

###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** 
NSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (""Say it, don't show it.""). 

###3)  **Reposts:** 
**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and top 100 may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.


###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** 
Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.

###5)  **Submission Titles:**

* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.

* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.

* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as ""My..."", ""Mine..."", ""Our..."", ""We..."", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.

###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** 
Please cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.

* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**
* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)

###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**

* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: 
  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing & ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.

###8) **Reddiquette, Comments & Subreddit Behavior:**

* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.
* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.
* The definition of what truly is ""Oddly Satisfying"" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.

###9) **Crossposts**
* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma.

* **2\.** Posting personal information (doxxing) will lead to an immediate, permanent ban. Avoid posting addresses at all times. Linking to a streamer's social media for a meta post or more information can be acceptable.
* **3\.** Do not be a detriment to the subreddit. Make a reasonable attempt to be a net positive, or at least neutral contributor to the subreddit. New reddit accounts will be under higher scrutiny.
* **4\.** Do not make politically motivated comments. This is not a politics discussion subreddit. (An exception is made for topics related to gaming and livestreaming).

*Submission Rules*

* **1\.** No biased submissions or self-promotion. Biased submissions and self-promotion include clips of your own stream, clips of a channel you are a mod of, friends, or any situation where you have something to gain from posting the clip aside from Reddit Karma. Do not create a submission with the primary intention of promoting someone.
* **2\.** No YouTube submissions to personal channels or compilation channels. Vlogs / meta videos may be allowed, we'll exercise discretion if the video is relevant to LSF.
* **3\.** No links to clips including banned streamers, or clips from their channels. The list can be found posted under the rules section and in the wiki.
* **4\.** No posts regarding swatting in any form.
* **5\.** No political clips or posts pushing a personal agenda (An exception is made for political topics related to gaming and livestreaming).
* **6\.** No clickbait. This includes all-caps titles and incorrect flairs.
* **7\.** No “he said it” posts (i.e. a video with racist donators or chatters). Note that videos of the streamer saying it does not fall under this rule, and may be posted.
* **8\.** Posts that fail to generate a reasonable amount of upvotes or comments will be removed to keep the subreddit history high-quality, as voted on by the community. 
* **9\.** Posts must be flaired correctly where appropriate. This also includes marking posts as NSFW/spoilers.

The following streamers are **BANNED** from this subreddit for breaking our rules. Do not post clips of their stream to the subreddit:
 
Athene, Cyberdemon531a, Ice_Poseidon, [Jellypeanut](https://streamable.com/n9yk2).

The most important rule is **Just Post**. If you've never had a post or comment removed it means you haven't been posting enough.

Our unique rule is that **all posts need to be titled ""me irl""**. Posts that aren't are automatically removed. 

We do not allow posts that reference suicide. This community is not equipped to handle this topic. If you are feeling suicidal [we have some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/suicideprevention) to guide you to people who help.

**Don't post NSFW**, or openly sexual. Even if you tag it.

**Avoid screenshots that are mostly text**, and feel contrived and performative. Show don't tell!

**Don't make posts that request upvotes** or any other kind of reddit metric (gold, comments, etc.). That age of me irl is over.

We have a filter that removes all posts from users with over 100k karma. A sub this easy to post to is maybe best for folks new at this game, and if you have this much karma maybe you should try doing something new? If you still want to post here, contact the moderators and we'll approve you!

&nbsp;",2vegg,me_irl,False,2881342
37,"**Rules**

**1. Imgur/Reddit image hosts only**


**2. Be creative**

Don't reuse old starter packs or just barely change them. Starter packs that are bland and overused may be removed at moderator discretion.

**3. No blatant or disguised bigotry**

Any use of slurs *in any context* is grounds for an immediate ban

**4. Be civil**


**5. No Politics**

Incidental political items in a starter pack are okay, but this sub is not an arena for political agenda posts or political arguments. You can use r/PoliticalPacks



**6. Starterpacks must contain 2 or more unique images. Screenshots containing only text and emojis do not count**

The userbase has decided that single item and text-only starterpacks are not starter*packs* and must contain more than one item. Duplication of one item to make up the pack can be seen as a subversion of this rule and will be removed at moderator discretion.


**7. Post title must include the name of the starterpack**  

The title of your post must include the name of the specific starterpack you are posting. Low effort, single word, irrelevant post titles will be removed at moderator discretion.


**8. No lists or example packs**

If your submission can be reworded as ""A list of X"", it will be removed.

**9.  No Reposts**

We want OC (Original Content).

38,"#**Rules and Guidelines:**
 1. Submissions must be unexpected on their own, and not rely on their title to surprise the reader. Don't give the outcome away in the title. 
Titles should not include ""unexpected, expected, expects, expect"" 

 2. Do NOT rehost webcomics. You may provide an imgur mirror in the comments.
 3. Mark all NSFW/NSFL submissions as such. **A warning tag on a post may mean NSFL, morbid content, gore, cruelty, etc. - 
No Death**
 4. Keep the comments civil; Do not provoke or get engaged in flamewars. No insults. Follow good [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

 5.  [No images of just text, or where the unexpected part is conveyed through text.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/7kqsxh/attention_everyone_regarding_pictures_of_text/)  
   
Please look through our [Top submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/top/) to avoid reposts. Frequent or recent reposts may be removed.

**Everything else will be balanced by votes; we maintain the right to remove posts at our discretion.**

[**RULES OF THE ROAST:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/about/rules/)

**Roastees:**

 * You must provide at least one high-quality picture of the roastee holding a handwritten sign with the text /r/RoastMe - Phones and Snapchat text overlay is **NOT** allowed! Hand and arm holding the sign must be visible.

 * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

 * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.

 * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&subject=Post Not Approved&message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet. Could you please approve my post? Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.

 * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.

 * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on ""Best Of"" and ""Highlights"" albums.

 * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.

 * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.

 * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.

 * No NSFW material. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.

**Roasters:**

 * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.
 
 * You are allowed to look through the roastee's post history.

 * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.

 * Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.

 * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**

If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.

There are some rules though:


* **Do not link source material. Ever. We will ban you if you do**
This includes asking for personal info, suggesting, implying or promoting  any kind of witchhunting at all. Don't do it. 


* Don't be an asshole. No hate speech, bigotry or personal attacks. 


* Don't post personal information. Cover up all usernames. Real or fake, yours or others.  This includes group names. Do not request personal information to be revealed. 
* **No memes or image macros** - screenshots of social media only.
* Avoid reposting.
* And the crazier, the better.

* Moderators have the final word when it comes to making decisions they deem to be in the best interest of the subreddit.  Do not privately message moderators about moderation issues.

**RULES:**

RULES | Description
---|---
**1 - Reposting is prohibited** | *Re-posting is not tolerated. It's annoying. Find something else to post or don't post it at all. Reposting anything from the [album of common reposts](https://imgur.com/a/RZDb87E) may result in a seven day ban.*
**2 - Copypastas are banned** | *Copypastas are BANNED! Any post where the ""cursed content"" is copypasta will be removed.*
**3 - Text-posts are allowed** | *Plain text posts are allowed, but an image of the cursed comment / description / thread is recommended.*
**4 - Stay civil** | *Refrain from being an asshole.*
**5 - Don't post content from shock accounts** | *Refrain from posting comments from ""shock accounts"" i.e accounts that specifically post ""cursed content""(/u/SatansLilCumrag666, /u/MagicFart69, etc.)*
**6 - Don't submit your own content** | *You cannot create and upload your own content. If the OP in the ""cursed content"" is the same OP that is posting it, it will be removed.*
**7 - Submissions must feature a comment** | *The primary element of your post must be a comment or a piece of cursed content which is otherwise textual communication between two or more people, such as a text message.*
**8 - Keep it cursed** | *A cursed comment is any comment that strikes the reader into oblivion. Upon seeing a cursed comment, your first reaction should be among the lines of “What the F*$k did I just read??” while leaving you speechless at the same time. Incomprehension of the comment just read, or the blatant gruesomeness of it should be enough to not only make you feel mystified but also to draw a smile on your face.*
**9 - Deepfrying is prohibited** | *Deepfried memes are not tolerated. If your post is garbage enough where you need to deepfry it for humor, don't post it.*
**10 - Moderator Discretion** | *Moderators may use discretion to upkeep the quality of the subreddit. Obviously fake or otherwise unsuitable content may be removed.*
**11 - Submission titles must begin with Cursed_** | *eg. Cursed_Potato.*

**[[Reddit Global Rules]](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/)**


-----

**[Content Restrictions](#r1)**

-----

**[1: Politics:](#blue0) [Political posts must be current.](#o0) Do not post any news snippets/articles/memes. Do not post about policy, allegations, or hearsay. If your post is political in nature it must include an individual or group actually behaving in a cringeworthy manner.**

* **[1.1: Agendaposting:](#blue0) If it becomes clear that your activity in this subreddit is dominated by fixating on a single issue, you will be confronted and you may be banned. It is okay to have strong opinions on an issue, but do not let them dominate your activity to the point where you are flooding the sub trying to push an agenda. This is an equal opportunity rule.**

* **[1.2: Be Civil:](#blue0) If you want to discuss politics or controversial/taboo topics in the comments you are free to do so as long as you can keep it civil. Your ideas will not get you banned, but the manner in which you choose to express them can and will.**

**[2: Explicit Racism and Bigotry:](#blue0) Refrain from making comments that are explicitly racist or bigoted. This is not a platform to proselytize race or gender politics. Intent matters here insofar as we are able to judge it, so try to keep your jokes and satire light and in moderately good humor.**

**[3: Don't Spam Posts:](#blue0) Spread your posts out. Don't post more than 4-5 things within a 6 hour period. Put some thought into your posts instead of just dumping an entire imgur album on us.**

-----

**[The Cardinal Rules](#r1)**

-----

**[1: Doxing:](#blue0) Remove all personal information from your posts and comments. (Please remember to block out usernames in your submissions)**

**[2: Harassment:](#blue0) Don't target individual users. Don't harass anyone who may be the subject of a post.**

**[3: Brigading:](#blue0) Do not ""invade"" or brigade other subreddits. Do not suggest a brigade or participate in one. We will catch you.**

**[4: Witch Hunts:](#blue0) Witch hunts of any kind are strictly prohibited.**

**[5: Violence:](#blue0) Do not glorify, encourage, or incite violence.**

# **About Us**

/r/trashy is a *celebration* of trash: people, things, media, etc. that boldly and shamelessly violates social conventions and cultural norms. Satisfy our voyeuristic drives by sharing trashy images, videos, stories, and fashion. All forms of trash are eagerly welcomed.

# Rule 1: **Behave yourself.** 
* Excessively derogatory comments unrelated to Trash^TM are not allowed.
* Bullying is not allowed. 
* Toxic behavior of any kind is banned. 
* To extend the rule above, heated ""social justice"" wars are not allowed on this subreddit. This rule encompasses the following hot-button topics: gender, trans*, rape, child support and alimony, race, ""cultural marxism"", slut shaming, fat positivity, Men's Rights, feminism, and anything related. If you feel the need to climb onto the soapbox about one of these issues, find one of the dozens of threads that pop up about it on every large sub, every day. You are not going to enact social change by having an impassioned discussion on a sub that champions people pissing in public. 
* No witch hunts.
* Do not direct link any personal information or social media profiles

# Rule 2: **Submissions must be appropriate for this subreddit.**
* Posts must be a **CELEBRATION** of trashiness, posts about horrible people doing horrible things without a shred of humorous trashiness to them will be removed and you may be banned. 
* No images of those whose ""trashiness"" is clearly the result of a serious mental illness.
* No pictures of people in healthcare settings (e.g. doctor's office, hospital, clinic waiting room) that they didn't take and post publicly themselves (aka no doctor's office creepshots).
* No porn unless it is excessively trashy.
* No child abuse or animal abuse. 
* No child porn.
* No fake trash. 
* No pictures of literal trash, bathrooms, pee, poop, discarded tampons etc
* No posts of horrible, evil, really awful things like gore or death or torture etc.
* No reposts.
* No license plates.
* Remove all family names / usernames from submissions. Any information that can be used to find the subjects posted here is banned.
* All NSFW posts must be marked NSFW.
* No memes / image macros. This includes social media status updates consisting **solely** of memes / image macros.
* Posts must be Trashy^TM of their own accord, context is helpful but not sufficient to make it Trashy^TM.
* **Please make an effort with your title**.
* All social media posts that do not include a photo **must include the comments**.

* No mass-produced novelty items such as bumper stickers, window decals or commonly posted t-shirt designs. 

* [Trashy Tumblr](https://internetdumpsterfires.tumblr.com/)

***
 [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/2sp32m/rtrashy_has_two_new_rules/) for information regarding  our two new rules.

# **Sidenotes**
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not a post is Trashy^TM. 
* Moderator discretion is used when determining whether or not behavior is excessively toxic. 
* Comment threads with rampant rule breaking will be locked.
* Sexualizing minors will result in an automatic ban.

## **NEW** RULES:

Don’t post:

1. Reposts, anything that’s been posted on this sub already is a repost. If the content is 2 hours old, it’s probably been posted already.

1. Low-effort posts, shit posts, shit memes. 
1. Anything NOT related to HK, doesn’t matter if it reminded you of HK, made you think of HK, you feel it’s relevant to the situation.
1. Anything only remotely related to HK, but doesn’t add to the discussion: a t-shirt you got, a graffiti you saw, a facebook post you screen capped, a picture you drew, etc.
1. Fake news/ sensationalized/ editorialized headlines. Do not change the headline of an article (except for translations). Fact check before posting.
1. Anything without context or is pure speculative.
1. Frequently asked but easily googleable questions, like how you can help, where to buy t-shirt/bumper sticker, what is the endgame, what companies to boycott, etc. Read the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxsz4i/megathread_resources_for_antiextradition_protest/), look at more posts, do a search, try googling. 
1. Anything of the other hong_kong sub or the sino sub.
1. Threats, harassment, racist/ sexist speech, slurs of any kind. 
1. Anything that breaks [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).

Also:

1. Flair your posts.
1. Report content that violates any of these rules. 
1. If you have questions about moderation, use the message the mods function, do not message the mods directly/ individually. 
1. If your post/comment isn’t showing up, it’s probably because your account is too new.
1. Failure to follow any of the above may result in removal of your post/ comment and/or permanent ban from the sub, without warning, at the full discretion of the mods.

**Official Subreddit of the PC Master Race** We're the largest community of PC enthusiasts on the Internet. [Begin your ascension today](//pcmasterrace.org/guide)!

#General Information

* Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
* Every kind of PC related content is welcome here. This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.
* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)
* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.
* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).
* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).
* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//goo.gl/QJTiaF).

* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).
* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons on titles or overusing them in comments.
* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.
* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.

* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: 
 - 6.1: Content that is unrelated, especially unoriginal, low quality, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys).

* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.
* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.
* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When we do giveaways we do it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but **don't mandate** subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Even if you do a giveaway on the subreddit, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine attempt at an answer

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

Please do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should ""google it."" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself. Users are coming to NSQ for straightforward, simple answers or because of the nuance that engaging in conversation supplies. LMGTFY links will be removed.

No responses being rude to the questioner for not knowing the answer. 

Exceptions: 

- On-topic follow up questions are allowed. 

- Link only answers permitted if the question happens to be ""What is a good subreddit for...?""

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette 

Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

Check out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. 

# DISALLOWED QUESTION AREAS

These types of questions are not allowed and will be removed:

- Medical advice questions

- Trolling or joke questions

- Suicide related questions.  Such questions are best handled by the great resources they have at r/SuicideWatch or r/Suicidology

- Questions along the lines of ""was I raped?"" or ""was I sexually assaulted?"" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/wiki/resources#wiki_rape_and_sexual_violence) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/wiki/help). 
 
- Getting people to view your product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question

- Illegal things - nothing like ""Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?"" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

- Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

- Other questions not asked in good faith - such as putting a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question. Any questions we suspect of being leading questions or asked merely to promote an agenda or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) will be removed.",2w844,NoStupidQuestions,False,1280610

64,"[A History Network Member](http://www.reddit.com/r/historynetwork/#/button/c/red)

This subreddit was created because there was a niche that was not being filled in the historical Reddit community. There was no place to be a redditor in history. All of your historical jokes and memes go here. (This is a place for memes, not propaganda.)

Our Friends (those who promote us are in bold):

* **/r/historyanimemes**
* **/r/animemes**
* **/r/roughromanmemes**
* **/r/redditthroughhistory**
* **/r/shittyaskhistory**
* **/r/LOTRmemes**
* /r/dankmemesfromsite19

Remember, this is the memes part of the historical community of reddit, not the historical part of the memes community of reddit. Treat it as such.

##**RULES:**


**RULE 1: Keep posts history related**

Please keep all submissions history related and based on historical events.  
1a. Memes about ideology, ie: Communism memes, are not allowed.  
1b. Memes about mythologies based on actual events such as biblical memes and Iliad/Odyssey memes are allowed, however, memes about Zeus etc. are not allowed.  
1c. ""Meta"" posts about the subreddit are okay.

**RULE 2: No untagged reposts**

You must put a 'REPOST' flair on all reposts. Reposts that are younger than 4 months or in the top 100 are not allowed and will be removed. You can check if a meme is a repost by using a reverse image search, however, if you want to be safe, you should put a 'REPOST' tag on any meme you did not make. 
 
**RULE 3: No discrimination or abuse**  

Any excessive sexism, homophobia, racism or any other form of discrimination will be dealt with harshly and mods reserve the right to impose bans without warning. Basically try not to be jerks.

**RULE 4: Year limit**

All posts must be of a subject of at least 20 years from the post. Example: 9/11 memes won't be able to be posted till 2021.  

**RULE 5: No fake caption style posts**

This isn’t r/fakehistoryporn. Don’t post memes that are fake, captioned pictures depicting historical events. For example: [Historical Event], 19XX, (Colorized) along with an unrelated picture.

**RULE 6: Do not deny or defend genocides and atrocities.** 

These include, but are not limited to; Holodomor, the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, Japanese war crimes and the Tiananmen Square massacre. Doing so will result in an instant permaban. Hateful historical revisionists are not welcome.

**RULE 7: Meme wars**

No calling for meme wars or inciting subreddit drama. Organising or participating in raids will get you a permanent ban. In the event of a meme war, you must abide by the rules of other subreddits when posting there. 

**RULE 8: No Brigading**

Directly linking posts to political subreddits is not allowed unless it is linked in a non-participating manner (i.e. linking ""np.reddit.com"" rather than ""www.reddit.com""). For more info see https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro

8.a Political talks in comments are ok but linking to external sights in which are about it are not

**RULE 9: Weekly contests**

Contest submissions must be OC, self-reposts do not count and contest submissions must also have the contest flair.

**RULE 10: No karma-whoring**

Posts, in the title nor meme, cannot ask for upvotes, say ""upvote this in x seconds for ___"" or say ""this post will only get x upvotes"" etc. Basically avoid the word 'upvote'.  
10a. Posting infoboxes that have no humorous intent will be considered karma-whoring. 

**RULE 11: No low effort titles**

Any post with a low effort title, ""interesting title"", ""[single letter]"", a single punctuation point, etc will be removed regardless of content.
Other low effort titles such as ""not a wwii meme"", ""my first meme"", ""got this from r/examplesubreddit"" etc. are also not allowed

**RULE 12: World War Two memes**

Memes about WWII are prohibited on weekends (EST). This includes anything from the invasion of Poland to the surrender of Germany (including the Winter war) for Europe and anything from the beginning of the second sino Japanese War to the surrender of Japan for Asia and the Pacific.

Meta memes complaining about WWII memes on this subreddit are prohibited every day

**Any rule breaking will result in either a temporary or permanent ban depending on the broken rule**

This subreddit is for posting screenshots, pictures, or stories of people who are being **way** too picky when it comes to who they beg for a relationship or any other matter.

**Rules:**

 1. Blur out identifying info (Age, Name(s), Location, etc). This includes OP's info.

 1. Please use [Imgur](http://imgur.com) or Reddit for image hosting.

 1. Please be nice to other users.

 1. Don't link to other sub-reddits (You will be banned)

 1. Don't incite others to visit the page a given post pertains to. Additionally, refrain from enquiring OP for the underlying source(s).

 If you ever notice brigading, please report and message the moderators

 1.  Person must be a beggar, such as: 
* **Person seeking goods or services at a reduced cost, for free, or for a laughably lopsided trade**
* **Person using social media, dating apps, or otherwise to seek out a specific type of relationship**


 1.  Person must be choosy, as in:
* **Person must have unreasonable standards or have a comical sense of entitlement**
 1. No reposts from top 100, front page or last 12 months.

 1. **Moderators may use discretion to upkeep the quality of the subreddit. Obviously fake or otherwise unsuitable content may be removed.**

 1. Please make an effort with your title. ""Found on Facebook"", ""This belongs here"", ""Saw this on snapchat"", ""🍆💦"" etc are hard to find later, give at least a little bit for us to go on, thanks.


#Here is what is NOT a ChoosingBeggar:

***
**Unattractive people seeking a normal relationship and having reasonable standards is not a good fit for this sub. Ugly people are allowed to want a partner with a job, or no kids, or anything else we would consider reasonable for the beautiful people.**

***
**A person asking for help with life's necessities out of desperation is not a choosingbeggar** 

* If someone ran out of money and needs gas money to get to work and the only thing they can think of is to make a status update on Facebook asking if anyone can spare them some money, they aren't really being choosy. They got the beggar part down, but this sub is not /r/beggars so that post wouldn't fit. If that same person turns down someone offering to give them a ride to work because they don't want to be seen in a PT Cruiser, then that post would fit.

*  A parent asking for handouts because their kids want an Xbox  for Christmas and the only way that could happen is if someone donates one, that isn't a choosingbeggar. That's someone begging, but without a sense of entitlement. If that person is offered a Nintendo and they scoff at the suggestion, then that would be a good post.

**The person begging must be at least in the gradient of being an entitled jerk, this sub is not a place to mock poverty**

67,"**History's cool kids, looking fantastic!**

A pictorial and video celebration of history's coolest kids, everything from beatniks to bikers, mods to rude boys, hippies to ravers. And everything in between. 

If you've found a photo, video, or photo essay of people from the past looking fantastic, here's the place to share it.     

**PLEASE READ OUR SEVEN QUICK RULES:**

1: Photos and videos must be over 25 years old. 

2: Please put the year or decade in title, otherwise your post will be removed. 

3: Spam, racist, homophobic, sexist and offensive comments, as well as brigading, consistent reposting and shitposting, will result in a lifetime ban. Offensive comments include anything about pimping, about people's moms and scoring women. Nobody cares about your sexual impulses, least of all the OP.

4: All posts highlighting, in the title, that someone has recently passed away or titles trying to evoke sympathy upvotes will be deleted. Please add the info in the comments.

5: All reposts less than six months old and all reposts less than a year old from Top 100 will be removed. 

6: All posts must feature a person.  

7: We reserve the right to remove any post that doesn't showcase historical coolness. This includes photos, which are not obviously retro and portraits of famous young women doing nothing but posing.

69,"Have a story of you or someone you know getting back at someone with pro revenge after being wronged? Post it here! 

[**Network of Retaliation Multireddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscalatingRevenge+GamersRevenge+OldSchoolRevenge+ProRevenge+myevilplan+pettyrevenge/)

**Rules:**

1. Your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting and/or funny way. In order for your story to be pro revenge, it should involve you going out of your way and going above and beyond to get revenge. If that isn't the case with your story, it may be better suited for another revenge subreddit such as /r/pettyrevenge or /r/maliciouscompliance.
 * Only revenge stories are allowed. If you have an idea for the subreddit, please message the mods to submit your suggestions. Meta posts may be allowed, but need to be cleared by the mods before posting.

2. The story does not have to be about you; it can be about someone you know or even something you saw somewhere else. However, stories must be feasibly possible. If the mods deem your post to be clearly fictional, it may be removed.

3. No posts asking for ideas of revenge, all posts should contain a full revenge story.

4. Do not post any personal information, real or fake, such as full names, phone numbers, addresses, facebook/twitter pages or email addresses etc. Posting personal information will result in an immediate ban.

5. Cross posts (x-posts) are welcome but please copy the text here, instead of providing a link. You may link to videos but your post will still need to describe the revenge (i.e. you can't just post the video link and nothing else).

6. Please, nothing too serious. No felonies or other nonacceptable/illegal stories. 

7. Bots and bot-like behavior are not allowed. 

8. Please be considerate in your posts and comments. No racism, sexism, personal attacks against other redditors etc. The mods may remove distasteful comments.

9. This sub is not your personal army. Do not attempt to use this sub to gang up on or promote a person, cause, or group.

10. Do not post comments calling stories fake without backing up your claims. You are more than welcome to point out inconsistencies or express your skepticism, but simply saying 'It didn't happen', 'fake', 'that happened', and the like do not contribute to the sub and create a toxic atmosphere.  

11. No acronyms or initials for names. Please assign your story characters fake names (first name only per Rule 4) or use titles like 'EntitledIdiot'.

The mods reserve the right to remove content at their discretion.

If you have any questions please feel free to message the mods.

Please link to the source whenever possible.

###Subreddit Rules 

*[Click for the subreddit's alternate rule list](/r/politicalhumor/about/rules)*


1. **Posts have to be about U.S. politics.** 

     In other terms, if it's not about American politics or elections, we'll remove it pretty quickly. 

     Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, etc!), but please keep posts civil. 

2. **Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.** 

 **Make an effort with your title:** Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous or descriptive.

 If it's isn't funny (or at least trying to be), we'll remove it. Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)

 If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. 


3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** 

    Screenshots of websites (Twitter, The Onion, etc), cartoons, memes or images with some sort of graphic are allowed. Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. 

4. **Images only.**

    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.

    Gifs are allowed as long as they are not excessively distracting.  

    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.

   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within ""allowed"" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.

  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. 

5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** 

 Use [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. If we recognize your post from yesterday, prepare to be cucked. Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.

 Users posting excessively or posting too many reposts may receive a temporary ban. 

6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** 

  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. 

  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. 

  If you're a jerk, including use of ""tard"" or anything related to Clown World, you'll be shown the door. 

7. **Do not brigade.** 

  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. 

 ___7b.___  **No ""Meta"" Posts.**

 Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.


8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. 



###Enforcement Policy 


* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** 

* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. 

* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message. We will politely tell you to go away if you fail to do this. 


* Users who are polite and understanding will be unbanned.  

* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://whitehouse.typeform.com/to/Jti9QH)

#####Welcome to Dunder Mifflin! 
Home to the Scranton Branch. 

This subreddit is for fans of the US version of the TV show, **The Office**. The show ran from 2005-2013 but is still watched just as much today. Join us as we discuss the show!

######[](https://redd.it/8ol0s8)

---

#####Rules

####1) Be Civil

Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. 

####2) No spam/Low-effort posts

Keep posts directly related to TV show ""The Office"". Low effort posts will be removed, [for examples and more info, click here](https://redd.it/95w3xk).

####3) No piracy

Don't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.

####4) No politics

No posts related to politics. They always result in uncivil discussion and aren't welcome here. 

####5) No asking for upvotes

This includes cake day posts and obvious karma farming. 

####6) Image hosting

Images, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.

####7) Self-Promotion

The promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.

####8) No Merchandise
Posts that are about items of merchandise (""look at this cool shirt"", ""I found this board game"", ""I made Cards Against The Office"") are prohibited without prior mod approval.

[Learn your rules](https://i.redd.it/w9drnp65p5b11.gif)

#####Guidelines:

####Reposts

Please do not repost. Frequent reposts will be removed, please search the sub before posting.

Recent reposts will also be removed. If you're posting a recent tweet/article/headline, it's probably already been submitted.

####Stay relevant

Make sure your whole post is relevant to the show, not just the title or image. If you have to give it a The Office title to make it relevant, it's now worth posting.

####Is your post low effort?

The following types of posts are low effort and will be removed:

* Pictures of your TV screen (especially ""are you still watching"" netflix screens)
* Actors in other TV shows
* IRL sightings of names related to the show.
* George Foreman grills, small TV screens etc
* Photos of Randall Park (Asian Jim) making a joke about how it's actually Jim
* Screenshots of the show with nothing else added to them
* Any post with an especially shitty title

[More examples here of low effort posts](https://redd.it/95w3xk)

####Unexpectedoffice

Screenshots of Reddit/social media comments referencing the show should be posted to /r/unexpectedoffice instead.

###5. No racism/sexism/homophobia

* **IF** a submission is a comeback due to someone being racist, that *may* be accepted. Otherwise, there is zero tolerance. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule5)

##[What is this place?](#icon-question-sign)

This is a subreddit dedicated to those gifs that just keep on giving. Whether they are mind expanding, funny, or just plain awesome, they are welcome here. 

In [the words](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/comments/6cflo5/these_taken_movies_are_getting_out_of_hand/dhucmt0/) of u/D-Shap ([paraphrased](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/comments/6cjrsb/just_to_clarify_this_is_gifsthatkeepongiving_not/dhv6w9a/) by u/mellamodj):

> r/gifsthatkeepongiving is generally for longer gifs that continue to provide entertainment throughout the gif's lengthy duration. 1 second gifs don't usually belong here because they give once, and then they replay. There is no opportunity for the gif to ""keep on giving.""

> r/Bettereveryloop is for shorter gifs that, when watched over and over again, get better every time.


##[What are the rules?](#icon-question-sign)



2. Gif must keep on giving. 

    Clearly. 
1. Use basic [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) 

2. Please submit the gif in .gifv form 

     a. Submit a direct link to the gif (like [this](http://i.imgur.com/OsdC58v.gifv), not like [this](http://imgur.com/OsdC58v)), and make sure that if the extension is .gif, change it to .gifv. This means that gif albums are not accepted either. Only pure gifs. 

3. Abstain from perfect loops unless they follow rule 1.

    a. ...and they just happen to be loops (like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gzr56BN.gifv)). If you have perfect loops, please put them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bettereveryloop)

4. Please abstain from reposting, but x-posting is welcomed. However, when you x-post, please reference source in the title, and/or post the source in the comments

5. Don't sexualize the people in the gifs. 

6. Keep reposts to things that are older than a few weeks. If it is on the first few pages of the [new tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifsthatkeepongiving/new/), dont post it. 

7. No gifs with sound

####[NORMAL THEME](http://www.reddit.com//r/unpopularopinion)
***

##**How This Place Works**
* **Upvote:** Opinions that you Disagree with.    
* **Downvote:** Opinions that you Agree with.
    

##**Rules** 
* **If you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.**  

- RULE 1: **Correct Formatting**  
The requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. The text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. You may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion.   

- RULE 2: **Opinion must be unpopular/controversial**   
This sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. If your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. **SO PLEASE SEARCH BEFORE SUBMITTING**.  

- RULE 3: **No Spam**  
New accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. Spamming will usually result to a perma ban.  

- RULE 4: **No Trolling**   
Trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. Trolls will usually get permanently banned.

- RULE 5: **Be Civil**  
Let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. Resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. Keep it civil.

- RULE 6: **Elaborate**   
An important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. There is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said.   
Your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod.

- RULE 7: **Hate posts are not allowed**  
Opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. Hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. Please be civil and and have respect. Bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia *activities* (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will *usually* count as hate speech. This does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. **Race baiting is a ban-able offence**  

- RULE 8: **No Low Effort/Satire Posts**   
Any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. This also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. Please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post.

- RULE 9: **No Reposts/Search Before Submitting**   
If essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). It WILL get removed. If your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there. Attempting to evade this rule may result in a temp- or perma-ban.

- Rule 10: **No US Politics**
Please do not post anything directly related to US politics. Topics that are politically charged but not necessarily political (abortion, immigration, economics, etc) are acceptable provided they follow all other rules.
There is an enormous number of places on the internet and on reddit to discuss US politics until you're red (or blue) in the face. You can comment in our weekly politics megathread if you want to discuss politics on the subreddit.

- Rule 11: **No Meta Posts**
A meta post is one that discusses the subreddit itself. Please do not make these posts, whether positive, negative or neutral, as the purpose of the subreddit is not to discuss the subreddit. We do have, from time to time, a stickied megathread for meta posts.

##[The Announcements Saga](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/saga)
*****
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
*****
*****


##Rules:

##1. No karma-related posts or posts asking for karma.

##2. No threatening or harassing other users.

##3. Posts must be memes related to the Star Wars Prequels.

##4. Posts inappropriate for viewing in public, like at work, must be tagged NSFW.

##5. No politics.

##6. No edgy or inflammatory posts.

##7. No brigading/encouraging brigading.

##8. No encouraging subreddit drama.

*****

##Details: 

1. No upvote/karma related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban.

2. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc.

3. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. ""Prequel"" refers to anything that takes place before A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas and EU content. This also includes Ewan McGregor posts, as they must be related to the prequels instead of just the actor (example: ""Literally a picture of Ewan McGregor"" is not allowed)

4. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother.

5. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts about politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics.

6. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. 

7. Brigading/Encouraging to brigade other subs (telling other users to downvote and raid another sub's content) will result in a permanent ban. This is against Reddit's Terms of Service, and is not tolerated here at all.

8. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods.

83,"##Welcome to /r/sadcringe! 
### /r/sadcringe is a place for awkward or embarrassing situations that also make you feel sad.  
  
(Please note: the 'sad' part of /r/sadcringe is in reference to when something makes you feel sad, it's not about calling someone out for *being* sad.)

[Example post. This image is good because it is sad, but also makes you cringe.] (https://i.imgur.com/uGnRtvo.jpg)

##Rules:

1. **Posts must be sad and cringe.** The content of the post must be both cringy AND sad. Unhappy, depressing sad – not pathetic loser sad. We're not here to make fun of people. The content should make you go: ""oof, that hurts"", not: ""lol, what a moron"". 

1. **No personal info.** This includes usernames, names, and any other identifiable information. This also means no direct linking to other subreddits in your submissions.

1. **No minors.** Do not post content that includes anyone under the age of 18. This WILL result in a ban.

1. **No bullying.** We will not tolerate any type of bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or incitement of violence. Violations will result in a temporary or permanent ban. Be nice.

1.  **No brigading.** Do not brigade or encourage brigading of this or other subreddits/websites.  

1. **Follow [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)** at all times. Failing to do so can result in a ban.

1. **No memes or obvious jokes.** We only accept real life situations. There are plenty of other subs for memes, jokes, and karma whoring.

[Official Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/As46dbG/#discord)
  
  
**Rules**

###1. Must fit sub. 
This sub is for so-bad-its-good humor. All posts must be images that are so stupid, juvenile, or generally bad that they become funny for the wrong reasons. Ironically bad posts are allowed, but ONLY if they could pass as something made unironically. Obvious satire is NOT allowed.

 [To determine if your post belongs, refer to this flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/comments/bclo2h/what_to_post_on_rcomedyheaven_flowchart/)

###2. Must not be better suited for other popular humor subs. 
Posts that exhibit the distinct styles of other popular humor subs are not allowed. These subs include, but are not limited to: r/4PanelCringe, r/okbuddyretard, r/dankmemes, r/DeepFriedMemes, r/surrealmemes, and r/youngpeopleyoutube.

###3. Must not contain banned content. 
Posts that contain content from the [banned content list](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/wiki/index) will be removed. The list includes tropes and memes that are deemed unsuitable for this sub.

###4. No reposts. 
No content that has been posted in the last 3 months or is in the top 50 all-time posts.

###5. No gore. 
NSFW posts should also be marked NSFW. Content can be NSFW without containing nudity; for example, a post that describes an explicit sexual situation through text.

###6. Keep your video clips short. 
Anything longer than 10 seconds will be removed.

###7. Moderators' Discretion

Moderators reserve the right to remove any post they deem unfit for the subreddit, even if it doesn't explicitly break any rules. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcomedyheaven).",h1pmw,comedyheaven,False,835276
86,"#RULES
1. **No personal information (surnames)/witch-hunting**  
The last thing we want is these cheeky boyos getting caught for their tomfoolery.  

1. **Must be still images. Must be social media screenshots.**  
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, reddit, and any other ones we forgot.

1. **No reposts from the last 2 months, or from the top 100 of all time**  
There's such thing as a madness overdose, some kid died of that last year.

1. **Reddiquette is to be followed**  
Ah here now lads, don't be twats.

1. **Feel free to message us mods, we’re here to help**  
All we ask is that if you are messaging us in relation to a post, please attach it in the message. Thanks!

1. **Make an effort cropping your images**  
We believe in well cropped stolen memes on this sub. We have high standards. 

***Mods may remove posts/comments at their own discretion***

#GUIDELINES:

###Before posting 

* Make sure to [ read the rules!](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules)

* This subreddit is for asking for objective explanations. It is not a repository for any question you may have.

* E is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.

* LI5 means friendly, simplified and layperson-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.

* Perform a keyword search, you may find good explanations in past threads. You should also consider looking for your question in the FAQ.

* Don't post to argue a point of view.


* Flair your question after you've submitted it.

>##**[Full documentation >](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)**

>**Hover to expand...**

##**1. Tag Spoilers**
>- **No spoilers in titles.**
>- **Use spoiler tags for anything that hasn't been revealed in the anime yet.**
>- **Do not leak spoilers outside of the thread for chapter spoilers.**
>- Please use the button labeled spoiler or put the word ""spoilers"" somewhere in the title for **posts** with spoilers in them.

> or
>\>!spoiler-text!<

>will show up as

>[Spoiler](/s ""spoiler-text"")
> or
> >!spoiler-text!<

##**2. No separate posts about the latest chapter for 24 hours after the release**
>- To prevent the subreddit from getting flooded with posts. 
>- The discussion and theories thread are the place to discuss the chapter. You must wait a day to post any other discussions in a thread. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**3. Fanart/cosplay must directly link to the source**
>* Use [saucenao.com](http://saucenao.com/)  and [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)  to find the source. [More >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules#wiki_3._fanart.2Fcosplay_must_directly_link_to_the_source)

##**4. Plain panels/scenes must create discourse**
>- **Don't post links to plain (or slightly edited) panels, pages, screenshots, gifs or scenes from the manga & anime.**
>- If you want to discuss a certain page/scene from the manga/anime please accompany it with an original analysis or discussion provoking questions. Otherwise it is considered a low effort type of post and will be removed. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**5. Posts must be directly related to One Piece**
>- The general rule of thumb is that if only a title or caption makes it One Piece related, the post is not allowed. 
>- This includes pictures/videos of things in real life which look similar to something from One Piece.
>- However, this is only a general guideline and the actual enforcement of the rule may vary based on content submitted. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**6. Mind our self promotion policy**
> - Self-promotion should be thoughtful, limited, and consistently well received by the community. The [9:1 ratio](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) should be generally followed.
>- **In addition, Youtube reviews and theorist videos must:**
> 1. Be in a text post format.
> 2. Summarise your video for the community or create new points to further the discussion of the videos.
>- [More >>](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules#wiki_6._mind_our_self_promotion_policy)

##**7. No memes outside the Mega-thread**
> * Use /r/memepiece. Subscribe to them! Also try /r/WrongPiece
> * Short jokes, and shit-posts are also memes
> * High quality, hand drawn, original content art, that is a meme may sometimes be allowed. See the full rules for examples. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**8. No hentai**
> - **No hentai.** Use /r/funpiece (NSFW) for that.
> - Anything too explicit but not necessarily hentai may also be removed. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**9. No posts about One Piece games other than news**
> - /r/OnePieceTC exists for One Piece Treasure Cruise
> - Posts for promotion of the game subreddits are allowed, following the self promotion rule. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**10. Do not repost questions answered in the FAQ or sidebar**
>- Use the search bar, your search engine, and the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/faq) to ensure that you are not reposting recent content or already answered questions. [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)
>- [Click here for recently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/search?q=flair%3Ahelp&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&sort=new)

##**11. Don't be a dick** 
> * Do not feed the trolls. If you suspect trolling, report and ignore.
> * Trolling, baiting, or (obviously) provocative comments may be removed at moderator discretion.
> * Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). [More >>](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**12. Flair your posts if required**
>- Posts should be flaired appropriately. [Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/flair) for a description of flairs.
>- Your post shall not be removed nor will you be banned for breaking this rule. This is more of an emphasized guideline than a rule.

96,"In search of answers? Ask the Reddit Ouija board!

---

**NEW:** Looking for an Italian-language Ouija? Check out /r/DimmiOuija!

---

For a no-spoiler version of AskOuija, visit https://ns.reddit.com/r/AskOuija! All answer flairs will be hidden.

---

**RULES:**

0) **No shitposting.** This includes posts that start with ""if this gets X upvotes...""

1) Posts must ask a question (or be answerable in some way).

2) All comments must be a single character, with a couple exceptions:

* If you feel that the Ouija has completed its answer, you may comment with ""Goodbye"" to end the thread.

* You may add commentary as long as it's a child comment of a ""goodbye"" (in reply to a ""goodbye"", in reply to a comment that's replying to a ""goodbye"", etc).

3) You may not reply directly to your own letter comment (this includes replying to your own letter with a Goodbye) but you can still reply multiple times in a thread.

4) **You may not help answer your own question.** You can still reply to a Goodbye, but you **cannot** add letters or Goodbyes. You've done your job; let the spirits do theirs.

5) **No bots.** (With the exception of the amazing Ouija Bot.)

*These rules are a work-in-progress and subject to change. Feedback is welcome.*

**The Ouija Bot** [[source]](https://github.com/mattdiamond/ouijabot/blob/master/ouija.js)

The Ouija Bot will flair threads with the Ouija's answer. It will do this for threads that contain a ""goodbye"" that meets the comment score threshold. It runs every hour on the hour (roughly).

**Goodbye threshold:** 10 points

(This is just the default... check the [Ouija Configuration Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOuija/wiki/configuration) for information on how to customize this value for your post.)

**Help! The flair on my post is missing or incorrect! What should I do?**

If you think the Ouija Bot should take another look at your post, report the post (*not* the Goodbye) as ""Missing or Incorrect Flair"". (**Update:** Due to changes in the reporting UI, you may need to select the category ""it breaks /r/AskOuija's rules"" in order to select ""Missing or Incorrect Flair"".) Once you've reported your post, the Ouija Bot will reprocess it the next time it runs.

Remember, you need a Goodbye with at least 10 points to have your thread flaired. If you want to lower this threshold, you can add a `minscore` setting to your post. For more info on this, check out the [Ouija configuration guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOuija/wiki/configuration).

[Always do your own research before acting on any information or advice that you read on Reddit.](/r/personalfinance/wiki/disclaimer)",2qstm,personalfinance,False,13948280
99,"#What is a Life Pro Tip?

A Life Pro Tip (or an LPT) is a specific action with definitive results that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way. 

You can expound in the comments, but the title must stand on its own. The tip  and the problem it solves must be in the title.

 If it takes more than the title, you have described a procedure, not a tip. 

Advice is not a Lifeprotip as we define it. Advice includes but is not limited to thinking about something a  certain way or  trying something hoping for better results.

Fortune cookies are not tips.

**NO POLITICS**

#LifeProTips Rules

1. Designate adult or non-family friendly tips as NSFW.

2. You must begin your post with ""LPT"" or ""LPT Request"".

3. Do not submit tips that could be considered common sense or common courtesy. Do not submit unethical tips. No spurious, unsubstantiated or anecdotal claims.

4. Use descriptive titles when posting! Your title should explain the gist of the LPT.

5. Posts must be either a life pro tip or a request for one.

6. No tips that are considered illegal in the United States. See: Grounds for permanent bans.

7. No religious or religion-related tips. We are a religion-free zone. Proselytize elsewhere.

8. Please remember to Flair your post for ease of navigation of the subreddit!

9. No tip piggybacking! Do not make tips in reaction to other posts on this subreddit. 

10. Don't tip copy. Word for word reposts of tips already tips will be seen as unoriginal and removed and may get you banned.

* Social media tips. This includes *all* social media platforms, from Reddit to Facebook to Instagram, Snapchat, etc.

**Note:** Moderators will use their own discretion to remove any post that they believe is low-quality or not considered a life pro tip.

#Banning policy

Bans are **given out immediately** and serve as a warning. **You may appeal** this initial ban by messaging the moderators and agreeing not to break the rules again. Please acknowledge the rule you broke!  ***Note: Bans will not be reversed if the post/comment in question has been deleted from your history.***

A temporary ban can not be appealed, and will expire at the end of the allotted time. 

**Note:** Homophobia, racism, harassment and general hate on ethnicity, sex, religion or anything else will result in a permanent ban that cannot be appealed. Tips that advocate/support illegal activities are also grounds for a permanent ban as well. Tips or comments that encourage behavior that can cause injury or harm to others will be cause for a ban. As the majority of LPT Mods are US Based, we will be using US laws to determine whether or not it's legal. 

Thank you.
