50,TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,161825,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. ",False,tifu
51,TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,137937,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",False,tifu
52,TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,137660,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

54,TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend’s phone NSFW,103959,"So this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

55,"TIFU by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my GF",103419,"Minor background: I am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. I'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay, I just am me.

So while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.

I'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.

Later on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

We are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

Tl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

57,TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.,96901,"Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""Yes, yes and yes!""  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""Dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""Diarrhea?""  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""Of course not."" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

""Keep it together, man,""  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

""You are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""Are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""Bathroom. Now."" she hisses. ""Get it together.""  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

""What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!"" she demands.

""Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.""

""REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.""

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


EDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.

As for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""Please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",False,tifu

His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening.

60,TIFU by having my reddit history revealed by Jimmy Kimmel live on TV,85250,"This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

61,TIFU by cumming into a coconut,81549,"EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.



EDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.

62,TIFU by asking Reddit which ethnic group to exterminate,78451,"Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, “Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they’re just boring and far too controlled”. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...’Hitlerish’. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I didn’t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let’s see what I go back to now...

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

EDIT: Thank you for the gildings you’re all giving me, it’s rather overwhelming.

The original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. 

As of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won’t necessarily be responding to them all.

I’m really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn’t the original intention, but it’s a great positive to take away from this experience!

EDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-

EDIT 3: UPDATE - It’s now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it’s back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they’ve subsided and I’m feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn’t think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

EDIT 4: Finally I’m able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it’s been a truly interesting experience. I didn’t realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn’t expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It’s 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

EDIT 5: Final edit, I’m now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It’s been great to see this happen, and I’m sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

63,TIFU by telling my son's new doctor we are Anti-Vaxx,78076,"Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

My son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

Toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which I reply, ""Oh, no he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.""

I should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

As my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, ""Okay, well I have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

Tl;dr: Jokingly told my son's new doctor that I didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

64,TIFU By agreeing to an “open relationship”,75415,"Obviously a throwaway. 

To put things into perspective, I (M 20) and my GF (F 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. Typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

We decide to spice things up a bit and “open” up our relationship a little. It was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole “sex is fun” idea.

She is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she’s met a guy (M 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn’t working at the time. I agreed. I tell her to go for it, and she does. She texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

The week after, she mentions she’s meeting up with this guy again. Wasn’t expecting it but I’m cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn’t text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she’s just having a good time?

The next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a “break” from “everything” right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we’re over. She’s completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she’s with him. I’ve heard from her friends that they’re dating now.

65,TIFU by sending nudes to my employee group chat.,74257,"TLDR at the bottom- 

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I’m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my “intentions” where with the video and that he’s never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂

66,TIFU by giving my son permission to beat his bully’s ass.,73821,"My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman’s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, “Dad, I’m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?” Well, my son isn’t really a fighter. He’s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he’s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he’s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don’t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. “Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.” I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. “I warned him.” I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn’t think he would and he did it.

EDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn’t malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn’t do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn’t the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully’s brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he’s disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!

Basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. This part is called ""Getting in the shuttle.""

As you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. This is considered ""Take off.""

If performed correctly, you should become VERY lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. This is called ""Being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

This is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **I, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. You see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. No oxygen = no consciousness.

When I ""Took off"" I fucking jumped up at Mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. Because the next thing I know I was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

Before I could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if I was okay. She heard my re-entry. This part is called ""Disappointing your mother.""

You can just imagine the scene she walked into.

She stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. I stared back with what I thought was confidence like I was Buzz Aldrin and just got back from the moon. But thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while I was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (At least not to my knowledge.)

She ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more Judge Judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. I cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. Somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and I managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

I'm currently writing this in my room right now, and I don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until I can think of what to say to her. If there is anything to say at all.

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.

“That’s okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I’ll have to go home”
“That’s fine” heh, cuz that’s all the time I’ll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??

No. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

It’s about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I’ve only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

So we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say “oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!” Which I’m excited about, because at this point I’m thinking to myself “hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid”

We talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn’t the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

Go inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to “watch HBOGO”.

She runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

It’s fucking Evan Williams.

And this is the first time where an “oh no” thought crosses my mind.

Kids, I’ve slept with some strange in my time. I don’t know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I’m a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.

So after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn’t even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

Sex.

So after, we’re just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We’re gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.

Now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?

Wrong.

I say “that was great we should do this again sometime”

“I don’t think so”

“What why?”

“I don’t think my husband would appreciate that”



I am speechless. I don’t think I’ve ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I’m probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

Me: “Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you’re at? Like, why didn’t you tell me that?”

Her: “idk, does it matter?”

“Uh yeah, I’d be pretty pissed if I was him”


Now I’ve been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I’ve been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn’t know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn’t get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.

So this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don’t remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

Her: “we’re getting separated soon”

Me: “well you’re still fucking married to him”

“Yea but that’s okay”

“How is that okay?”

“He’s been..... abusive”


There’s a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She’s in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I’m trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

Que the panic attack.

She starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.

She asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).

Now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me “(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy” Btw, Evan Williams isn’t that bad when you’re slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

We finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn’t like morning sex. I’m still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.

Anyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can’t because she didn’t know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn’t move it because “I didn’t know how to drive it” 

“Uhh, this is the third time we’ve had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car”

I move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she’ll probably leave before I get home.

A couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I’m starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn’t think to log out or shut it off or anything.

I tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

Go back to work. Thinking everything is over. That’s the end of that. Wrong again.

I get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I’m worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She’s refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

Oh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.

She hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she’d Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

I kid you not. I’m sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says “make it quick”

This bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I’m just ready for her to leave.

Sex.

After, we’re just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I’m like 

“I’ll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on”
“No”

“What do you mean ‘no’? You can’t get in an Uber with your pussy out”

“No”


So I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.

Most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That “arch” thing that women do when you’re pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.

Pizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.

We never even opened the pizza box. She’s saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I’m starting to panic myself. Because I don’t know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.

She eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that’s she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it’s her sending multiple texts saying “I’m so sorry babe” “idk where I’m at” “come get me”. And him saying “nope sorry” “this is on you” and “call 911”

That last one though. That’s what I did.

Before I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I’m starting to worry about my safety. I don’t want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that “you don’t know how to drive my car” with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

I told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn’t answer.

The ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, “girl you need to get dressed, you’re gonna be going home”

Finally got her panties back on, I didn’t tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.

Cops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can’t force her to go anywhere she didn’t want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She’s still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I’m like “I guess?”, and then I let them in.

She yells “are you fucking serious? You called the cops?” 
“Uh yea, you didn’t wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that’s what I did”

The officer said to her “you’re on this man’s property, and he wants you to leave”

Que crying and what not.

Cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what’s happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn’t do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.

I had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer’s partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.

Anyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she’s still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. “I don’t think they’ll let you take that”

Cops didn’t let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say “usually this is the other way around, ha”

Po-po leave, I call it a night, and it’s over.

Flash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she’s asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn’t able to check. But I’m 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.

Oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

So that brings us to now. I haven’t heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I’m glad I could share this story with y’all. There might be more to come, but you’ll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

The moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

Jk don’t do that.

And don’t stick your dick in crazy.

TLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married. She trashed my house.

Edit: I’m not gonna change “que” to “cue” because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while I deal with mine.

Edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2GIa

Edit 3: her car is still there. Can’t get it towed, because it’s on a public street. I’m still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I’ll get to them when I can.

Edit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn't. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.

Edit 5: I’m still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor’s house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it’s front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she’s most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her “hey do you wanna get this car that’s in front of your house towed?” She said “no, noooo hehe” I’m like “yea, I’ll talk to y’all tomorrow” just wtf.

**UPDATE**

I’ve been texting a mutual friend of the couple. Apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. I’m in the works of a TIFUpdate. But I’ll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. I’d like to protect the privacy of those involved, but I’m just too lazy to do it right now.",True,tifu
71,TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag,67103,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

Wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*Edit 2*

I don't think I'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn't change any names

Ok it's been fun everyone, I may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce.

Uhh this post is getting deleted. It's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

Final edit. Fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. Apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on Reddit) how big of a dumbass I am.

72,"TIFU Update: I fucked up by not knowing the guy I like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass.""",66057,"Link to OG post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

Two months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. 

Basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, ""I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. 

I didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""Oh fuck,"" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""Hey [my name], how was your break?"" 

I looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, ""Is that all your having for lunch?"" and I was like, ""Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

Then he said, ""Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?"" 

I was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. 

Well. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?"" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you."" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

Even with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

Well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

We have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I'm a girl (got two comments asking if I was).

Edit: Yes, I accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" My b, my b. ",True,tifu
73,TIFU by genuinely forgetting I had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in Amsterdam and getting caught.,64851,"So this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

I would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

Came with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It’s a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

I’m sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit ‘coffee shops’ and buy and smoke joints. 

Had a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

In a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...’did I ditch that joint’?

At this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

‘Sir, do you have anything in your pockets’ says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

Holy. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I’m still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

Go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I’m asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I’m sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

‘Sir, empty your pocket please’? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

I’m dying inside. I say to pat down guy, ‘oh god. I’m really sorry, I forgot that was in th...’
‘HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY’! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

I’m placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

Customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, ‘Don’t worry Sir! Don’t look so scared! You are 20th today and you won’t be last! I’m sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can’t let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home’. 

I almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he’d taken joint off me....and that was it...

I’m in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You’re the best. I’m sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

TLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Got caught with it. Dutch customs were amazing about it. 

Edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

Edit 2, Thanks for the shiny stuff. First awards (on a story about my drug use).  I’m from UK for those asking.. My flights just landed and I made it through UK customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. I’ve just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. It says under what was taken, ‘joints’.

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

75,META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world,76229,"I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: Wow, this got very big. It’s gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

And alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. Academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody’s business, so I might have a warped view on this one. 

Edit 3: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”",False,AmItheAsshole
76,"UPDATE, AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?",72774,"I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

Well, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying ""You were put here to be her caretaker"". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.

I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.

So, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200B;

Late edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200B;

We just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",False,AmItheAsshole
77,UPDATE: AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?,66076,"I want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. Everyone’s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

Since I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I’m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

The funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. 

My sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. 

When Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

We went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

I’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

I haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. 

That’s it. Take care everyone.",False,AmItheAsshole
78,"META: Too many AITA commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.",53297,"I’ve become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP’s to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

When we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

Encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don’t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

Please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",False,AmItheAsshole
79,AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?,51463,"We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",False,AmItheAsshole

81,Aita for wearing the “joke” bikini my friend got me?,48146,"So it was my birthday couple months ago. Had a party. Got some gifts. My friend “Mandy” for me a “super cute bikini”. I liked it. Said thanks. She had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

Anyway. Went to the community pool with my roommate. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... I look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

Haha good joke Mandy. 

Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. 

We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew?

82,WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,46996,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. 

That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",False,AmItheAsshole
83,AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?,46795,"The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200B;

My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200B;

I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200B;

I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.

&#x200B;

Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200B;

It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200B;

I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?

Edit/Update kinda:

Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house.

84,AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?,45408,"I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids.

85,AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?,45284,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time.

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". 

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd ""threatened"" to do it before (I literally just said ""okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything"" before).

87,AITA for making a dad joke?,42843,"Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.”

88,AITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?,41864,"Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.

I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.

I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING.

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback).

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub. 

---

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",False,AmItheAsshole
90,AITA for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?,40735,"**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200B;

My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200B;

Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200B;

After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?

91,AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?,40440,"**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. 

He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. 

He told my family and they think i’m the asshole. AITA?",False,AmItheAsshole
92,AITA for telling cashier that wasn’t the girls credit card?,40017,"
Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

93,AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?,39975,"I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time.

I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

95,UPDATE: AITA for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?,39669,"This is the original post: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

I first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. It honestly helped me so much and without it I don’t know if I’d end up in this position.

So I went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. They of course said no. I’m kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. Afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he’d come to me if it meant so much. However he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn’t work he’d definitely accompany me to the principals office.

So I went to my teacher. I already knew how everything was going to go out so I didn’t have any hope. I told her that I don’t appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues I would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the Mrs.). She told me that I was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. I told her that many people don’t think she’s fair and in return she just looked confused. I handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she’s my English teacher). Her face went from nothing to just sadness. I swear it was so weird. It’s like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

She apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. And saying my name just gets her bad memories I guess? She told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. At this point I kinda felt guilty because I never took this thought into consideration.

She told me she’d try to say my name ( and won’t cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime I can still call her by her first name. ( All my classmates are jealous because I’m the only person allowed lol)

We’ve talked about the past detentions she’s given me and she said she’ll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

Honestly this isn’t how I thought things were going to turn out. And I’m pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",False,AmItheAsshole
96,"Hey Assholes, you're doing it wrong.",38921,"Since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time I ranted about voting on this sub. So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

You may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

As you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

Also important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. If you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and GTFO. You have come to the wrong place.

P.S. If you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. Maybe you're not an asshole after all.  


Edit:  I see a lot of people in this discussion suggesting rules we already have in place.  I suggest you read the full rule book and the FAQ if you think you've got a new idea.

97,AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,38430,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

98,"WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?",38240,"My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?

99,"AITA for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?",38057,"I fucking hate wedding culture.

It's bullshit.

My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

We put our foot down and said:

>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

We are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

**ORIGINAL POST BELOW:**

I am a veteran playing Battlefield since 2002 and using origin since launch.

Just two weeks back I wasn't able to login to my Origin Account (with Battlefield 5 Pre-ordered). I contacted EA Help and they are telling there there is no trace of my ID. I provided them my transaction IDs, Order IDs, Game Keys, But they are telling that they have no info. In fact they don't even know what happened. EA Help mercilessly disconnected the conversation with vague explanations.

My account has games worth thousands of Dollars which includes BF1942, BF1 Premium, BFBC2, BF3 premium, BF4 Premium, BF5 (pre-ordered), Unravel 1, Unravel 2, TitalFall 2, Battlefront 1, FIFA 18, Medal of Honor, etc.

I even went to call them but they said that they can't do anything and don't know anything. Everything gone! but more surprising is that EA isn't even telling me what happened. They told me it's not their responsibility.

When i search in Battlelog and origin I still get my profile.

(The DP is my real picture from my days in Indian Air Force - Served for 10 years)

**Update: Final Response from EA : ""We don't know anything about your account""**

*Himanshu: I told you that there is no such   information about ""\*\*\*@live.in""*

*you: ok what next??*

*you: i want my games back, I have the receipts,   the credit card transactions, everything*

*you: how to get them backHimanshu: There is no account.*

*Himanshu: There is no details.*

*Himanshu: So I am unable to follow any process for   you.*

*you: but how is it my fault...??? EA should be   able to get me back what I purchased\*\*...*

*Himanshu: The deletion request was requested from   your side.*

*you: Atleast show me the acknowledgement   evidence that someone who knows me requested for deletion of my account.. I   don't even have any emails on this*

*Himanshu: How should I provide you any information ?*

*Himanshu: There is no account.*

*Himanshu: There is no case.*

*Himanshu: There are no such information.*

*Himanshu: There are nothing.*

*you: But that is EA's thing to keep.. how can i   know if someone did it... and how can someone do it without having access to   my email id and my mobile phone.. while 2FA was active*

*you: I have receipts so atleast give me my games   back and get me a new account*

*Himanshu: There is no way to verify your proof of   purchase.*

*Himanshu: We are unable to fetch any information by   your game codes.you: nowhy?? i have transaction IDs, I still   have that credit card, i have receipts, i have the same phone no, same email  \*\* id*

*you: why can't it be verified*

*Himanshu: Because all your details were on your   account.*

*Himanshu: And now there is no account.*

*Himanshu: So how can we verify you and your purchases \*\*  ?*

*you: But my bank has the transaction IDs that i   paid to EA... your billing team will have that*

*you: the way you want...you: i have access to everything related to this   account except for the account itself that is on a portal managed by you*

*Himanshu: I checked your previous case.*

*Himanshu: We consulted with the billing team.Himanshu: We don't have any information.*

*Himanshu: So we are unable to verify you and your   purchases.you: so what is your final call on this?*

*Himanshu: If you want a call back service.you: yes i do*

*Himanshu: I can generate a call back service for you.*

\*Himanshu: Please share your number. *you: my no is +91\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**

*Himanshu: Thank you.Himanshu: Now please cancel the browser\*\*.*

*Himanshu: You will receive a call from our side   within 3-4 hours.you: can you tell me what is the resolution to   this from your end and what is the take away from this tiresome converstaion?*

*Himanshu: I tried all the possible ways for you.*

*Himanshu: But when there is no account I was unable   to locate\*\* anything\*\*.*

*Himanshu: I will generate a call back service for \*\*  you.*

*you: wthe take away is it is not reliable to buy   anything on Origin as anytime it can be deleted and EA will blindly tell it   was deleted and would give no evidence of it*

*Himanshu: So you can receive \*\* a call support\*\*.*

*Himanshu: If we deleted your account that means   account deletion was requested\*\* from your side.*

*you: but you didn't give any proof or any mail   from my id that requested it??*

*you: how can you claim that i requested it*

*you: that is really lame*

*Himanshu: How can you expect any information ?*

*Himanshu: When there is no account\*\* anymore.*

*Himanshu: Everything is linked to your account.*

*Himanshu: Okay.*

*you: and my account was deleted by EA so ??????   what are you trying\*\* to suggest????*

*Himanshu:\*\* We never do that.*

*you: can't you yourself see that these are all   vague arguments.. just going in circles*

*Himanshu: Request\*\* was from your side.you\*\*: prove it*

*you: provide email that came from my id for   deleting this account*

*you: where is acknowledgement from my end*

*you: ??*

***Himanshu: Could you please prove it the deletion request \*\*  was not from your side ?***

*you: Yes i can... as there is no case ID nor any\*\*  \*\* email that I sent*

*you: there is nothing related to deletion in my   mail box...*

***Himanshu: Just like you I can prove that we didn't   delete y\*\*our account from our\*\*\*\* sid\*\*e.***

*you: wow....*

*you: thanks*

**Update**: My case ID has been deleted by EA. I have tweeted this to Battlefield & DICE already. As of now I have no way to even track this and have been asked to wait. Atleast they considered taking a look.

[https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr)[/status/1028218856605536257](https://twitter.com/FlyingOffr/status/1028218856605536257)

**Update 2:** Reddit Mod has removed my post. not sure why

**Update 3:** Reddit Mod restored my post.

**Update 4:** I have provided my credit card details (last 6 digits) to EA although it seems they have no clue about my account. At this stage I have lost all hopes on getting this back. Waiting for an update.

**Update 5:** Sarah from EA has told me that they have failed to get any details related to my account and have asked me to create a new Origin account for which they will add Battlefield games. Not sure about other games so far. I have collated the Order IDs, Game keys (as much as possible) and last 6 digits of my credit cards and waiting for update. So far the response from EA has been really cold and I am getting repeated and vague questions in emails again and again even when I provided all these details long back.

**Update 6**: I am continuously trying to reach EA using various channels (including Sarah's mail ID) but I am getting no response. They have made me create a new ID and assured to provide me everything back but I still haven't got all of my games (including Battlefield 5 Pre-Order) and my soldier name i.e. FlyingOfficer.

**Update 7:**  I have got a response from EA just minutes ago and they are working on something although what they are offering is not what I want.  All I want is my games that I paid for (I have valid bank transaction IDs) and my soldier name i.e. ""FlyingOfficer"".  I will update once they confirm me on this. So far on a higher level they have told me that ""We cannot assure anything at this moment"".

**Update 8:** Sarah from EA has helped me in getting my soldier ID back (FlyingOfficer) and added most of all the games (Except for Battlefield V Pre-Order) into my new account. She has also provided me 12 months of free Origin Premier membership ( I didn't ask for this). Although my stats history is gone I am quite satisfied that I got my soldier ID back. Waiting for them to restore my Battlefield V Pre-Order.

[https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/764limsw8pf11.jpg)

**Update 9**: Battlefield 5 Pre-Order has been restored into my Origin Account.

**Update 10:** My Battlefield 1 Stats have been restored.

&#x200B;

**LETTER OF THANKS**:

**A big thanks to the gaming community who came in hordes to support me (brings tears in my eyes, literally)** while all doors were closed for me and EA Help shamelessly rejected my support requests. Had I not got this much of support, I don't think I would have ever thought of going back to Battlefield.>>Having said that **I want to strongly back the developers (i.e. DICE) of Battlefield and the Franchise itself as they have delivered to us some of the best First Person Shooters in last 15 years.** This incident and events that have unfolded thereafter (including the immense support from the good guys in this world) will be an unforgettable experience for me and **my support and enthusiasm for Battlefield 5 the future releases will be the same as ever**. For the game and the developer Studio DICE, I have only accolades and I have always wanted this franchise to win the competition. Although when it comes to Electronic Arts. I do have a lot of complaints and won't stop criticizing it for being so money hungry and pathetic (especially User Support and Business Strategies). I wish DICE wasn't associated with EA but that is far from getting real. **I request all of you to not lose your trust in Battlefield and the developers who have put their heart and soul in bringing Battlefield to us.**\>>The key takeaway is that none of us should remain silent when mammoths in the industry try to suppress us and we should give corrupt people a strong fight. If EA doesn't know how to treat us then let's teach them, all together. Let's make videos and post which highlight the security and data retention flaws of EA.>>Thanks,>>(Samarjit Roy Choudhury)>>Origin ID: FlyingOfficer>>Thanks to YouTubers, [Drop Rate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRJsZ5d8QdIvaoxCNV9KyLg), [SidAlpha](https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyWolf779) & [ReviewTechUSA](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReviewTechUSA) for making videos on this issue:>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5zPyD0SA0Y)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu67uPlezCs)\>>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls64hxpqt_E)

392,Thanking God for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.,39826,"I'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but I've seen enough posts and comments online. I've had enough.

I have nothing against religion. You can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. However, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

I've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""God is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

No. I don't care how real you think he is, God had nothing to do with that. Those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not God - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. God did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. God did not come down from the heavens. God did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. God did not do that surgery. *They did*. And saying that God did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. It completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *Especially* if that person is not religious.

Sure. You can call it a miracle or God's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. God didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. It doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

But to say that God did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. It's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. You're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. It's just wrong.

**Small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: I recognize that starting this off with ""I have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. But I don't have anything against religion as a whole; I have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. It's a simple matter of a lack of respect. Additionally, I don't mean the common ""thank God!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. What I mean is the active, continuous thanking of God versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking God and not those involved, or simply making God the main focus of the gratitude).

And, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren’t honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest Marvel releases. 

From a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren’t good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. The stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques.

395,I'm a guy and I wish I could be pregnant,39378,"I think pregnancy is wonderful. I know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant. Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

I pull up at Walgreens and I walk over to the aisle with condoms. I go “well shit, I guess i need some deodorant too.”  So I pick some up and then grab a box of condoms.

I get to the checkout line, i’m standing there and this one old lady is like “excuse me son, mind me asking how old you are?” And i’m like “Ummm I’m 16?” Then she purses her lips and makes this judging ass face and says, “Aren’t you a little young to be using those?”

At this point the other 5 people in the line are all looking at me so I got angry and just started acting snarky. “Oh, my bad lady, Imma just hit it raw and hope she don’t get knocked up.”  She felt offended so she shut up pretty quick. 

AND THEN when I get to the front of the line, the fucking cashier scans the box, smiles and says, “first time with these?” Are you fucking kidding me? Why would he ask that? Whatever. I just said “Um no second actually.” (Even though it was actually my first).

Ughhh. Anyways I hate people. I just want to buy some condoms in peace damn.

601,I cheated and I feel like crap. Not sure how to tell my girlfriend.,74187,"Background story: I've been dating my current girlfriend for almost a year. In fact, we are celebrating our anniversary next month. She's a wonderful person who has been nothing but fully supportive of whatever I do. I've started a low carb diet and lost around 40 pounds in 6 months. While everyone was criticizing it (oh you need carbs, this is unhealthy, blah blah blah), she was there for me through and through. In fact, she got on the same diet and lost 5 pounds just so we both have the same routine and plan. Throughout my weight loss journey, she'd always compliment me and make me feel better about myself (I kind of had some self-esteem issues). I've reached my weight goal a few weeks ago and I'm over the moon. I've been hitting the gym to gain muscle, joined and completed marathons, but the most surprising out of all was the attention I've been getting from women. Something that never happened before. 

So last night, I was out with a few friends without the gf. She claimed to have a headache, but I'm pretty sure she's planning our anniversary (she loves planning stuff). I get to the bar, and there were a bunch of people that I haven't seen since highschool 10 years ago. One of which was a cute girl I remember from back then. I was chatting with her throughout the whole night. She was so amused by my weight loss and she told me how she wants to become a nutritionist and help people out. We had so much in common that made me lose track of how much I drank. Since I'm on low carb, alcohol gets me drunk so much faster. Everyone gets drunk also and decides to head back to the girls place. I, on the other hand, was completely wasted so I can't remember most of what happened. I woke up in the morning with one hell of a hangover, and my friend filled me up with all the events from last night. I was mortified. Apparently, they all got pizza and I ate a whole meat cravers pan crust with extra cheese pizza all by myself. I can already see the disappointment in my gfs face.

3. The kindergartners are unarmed. They are just going to run at you, attempting to punch, kick, bite, and scratch you. Their ultimate goal is to cumulatively dog pile on you and pin you to the ground. If they can pin you for 15 consecutive seconds, you lose.
4. You have to knock a kindergartner unconscious in order to defeat them. Once they are knocked unconscious, they vanish from the classroom arena.
5. You can use any strategy you want to fend them off, but you are also unarmed and you are not allowed to leave the room.

He would frequently bring girls back to the dorm even though he claimed he had a girlfriend. Anyways one night he brought a girl home who woke me up at 3am by screaming during sex. I consider myself to be a calm reasonable person so I did what any calm reasonable person would do. I got out my phone connected to the Bluetooth speaker in his room and played a [video](https://youtu.be/xFOeQDJjSos) about queefing at max volume. She shut up really quickly and my roommate told me they were so embarrassed they just layed on the bed listening to some girl explain queefs to them for five minutes. I slept like a baby after that. 

Edit: I guess I need to clarify that my roommate wasn't actually mad at me. It wasn't the first time he had loud screamy sex in the dorm room and I was getting sick of his shit so that's why I got him back. I ignored it the first couple of times and when it got to be a semi regular occurrence I knew it was time to go nuclear on his ass. Anyway the next day he admitted he deserved it and he would try to be more quite in the future. 

Edit 2: Come on guys some of you are bashing me for not taking the moral high road on someone who woke me and my two other roommates up by screaming in our ears during sex at 3am in a shared dorm room. They made it awkward for us so I made it a thousand times more awkward for them and had fun doing it. I regret nothing. He got what he deserved.

Edit 5: All your punishment is making me so hard.  I'm not even using hands any more I'm just slapping my dick on the keyboard now. It's just you and my dick now. Break my body. We have already established I'm a virgin loser, but come on go harder guys. Keep telling me how pathetic I am. You are about to make me into a ragging love fountain from your punishment.

Edit 6: *Fifty Shades of Mediocre Penis*

*Chapter One*

It was a snowy cold winter Sunday. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 was celebrating his victory over his horny loud roommate when all of a sudden he got a comment from /u/Aguynamedtony. Was it more fans from the internet who also wanted to celebrate in his victory? Hurriedly he opened it and he eagerly read over the contents.

""Why you getting back at them you get your nut why cant they get theirs. Oh I see the problem you ain't getting no nut off makes sense! Jealousy is a terrible trait""

/u/MediocrePenisNumber6's heart sank. It wasn't from a fan it was from someone clearly superior to him. He was right /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 was indeed getting no nut. It was like all the other messages and comments that he had gotten before. He was a dirty virgin loser unfit to be called a man. He was still in denial before, but this one, this one sank home. The truth hurt so much. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 began to feel a deep pain in his chest. He started to cry. But wait it wasn't from his eyeballs that he was crying it was another type of ball entirely. He started to feel some new emotions spring up inside him. /u/Aguynamedtony's rough manly treatment of him made the pain feel... what was it he thought? It was good. The pain felt so good. Then he knew he had seen the light. /u/Aguynamedtony was going to make /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 go from a dirty cuck virgin into a manly sex god who screamed fucked wherever he pleased. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 was no longer mediocre. His penis was crying big fat tears of his pre boy goo. He could no longer contain it he ripped off pants smashed his precum soaked hard cock right on the part of the screen that had /u/Aguynamedtony's comment. He stared deep into the pixels of his user name. To put it bluntly he fucked the shit out of that computer monitor. He broke the screen but it didn't matter the electric shock and broken glass just sent waves of pure painful pleasure up his penis. With one mighty fuck scream he sent a geyser of his boy love over the broken computer with such force that he knew his ancestors would be proud. But before /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 could fully bask in his glory he felt a hard hand on his shoulder. He had forgotten he was in the campus library. As he was being dragged off he reached out desperately wanting to remain with that which had turned him into a man. But his love was but a tragic one for there was nothing he could do. He had to leave his love behind. /u/MediocrePenisNumber6 cried tears of anguish as he knew he would never see the man who had bestowed manhood on him again.              ",False,AskMen

I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn’t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

627,I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.,66167,"Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",False,relationship_advice

I will let you know how I manage.

Thank you again.

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

629,HAPPY UPDATE: It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can’t have kids and she still has not “gotten over” it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.,61522,"ORIGINAL POST: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b1982e/it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we\_learned\_that\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1982e/it_has_been_7_months_since_we_learned_that_my/)

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dear \[Wife’s name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I’m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won’t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don’t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I’m ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her “I love you so, so, much”, and started crying too. I honestly don’t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could’ve been 10 minutes, it could’ve been an hour, I didn’t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don’t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words “I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.”

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She’s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We’re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

630,[Update] I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I talked to her.,60370,"I would like to preface this post with an apology. I know it has been nearly three weeks since I last posted. To be honest, in no world did I ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. I've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. Not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original It, I have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. For that, I am sorry.

For the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. It is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

For the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a Greek tragedy, I apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

Now to start where things left off.

After making my original post, I combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a Plan B box and thrown it into the garbage. A lot of them made sense. My greatest hope was that it might have just been old. Maybe it was before we even met. Clinging to that, I hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. I'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what I would say in response, and what I would do. I memorized them all.

On the evening after I made my original post, I called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. As I had practiced, I asked her the following question:

>Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? 

The second the words ""Plan B"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. She was completely lost for words. I already knew at that point. I retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>Why was there a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? You know I had a vasectomy. 

She just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. Then she looked to the floor. Then she started weakly sobbing. 

This was not on the flowchart. I had no idea how to respond. I thought if I let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. Finally I prompted her with another question:

>Are you crying because you did something you regret?

She shook her head violently. I was so concerned because I thought something horrendous might have happened.

She abruptly shrieked ""I'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" I have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

So I prompted her again. 

>Just tell me why it was there. You don't have to hide anything from me.

She yelled at me again. Repeatedly. ""If you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""Fuck you for not trusting me.""

This line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. I refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, I wasn't budging an inch. She then informed me that either I had to leave or she would leave. Since I doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), I agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. I went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

The following night, I texted her asking if she was ready to talk. She was not. Instead, she gave me an ultimatum: I had to [1] apologize, [2] promise to never bring it up again, and [3] learn to trust her completely. Only then would she allow me back home. If I couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

I have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. I am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. I currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. The lawyer will probably tell me I'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

There is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. I am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. None of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. I'm holding off on saying anything until I'm calm and rational and won't do something I'll regret in the future.

I don’t know what to do, since I don’t want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).",58796,"Hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my [previous post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he’s taking it so well and he told me he’s experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn’t allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he “got his head straight”. 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn’t give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they’d be in love with him. 

Well I think it’s working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn’t start eating until he arrived.

632,"Update : Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and ""our twins""",53564,"It has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all.

633,My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,45180,"My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

634,I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,44961,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since.

He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant"", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision I ever made"" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from ""I am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and I will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

Edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",False,relationship_advice
639,UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,39130,"Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

640,"UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I’m the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?",38483,"Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they’re being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn’t believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here’s how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn’t true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would’ve given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he’s going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He’s definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish.

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**

I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.


Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said ""How Jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.


Good luck to everyone in their lives.

I played and listened. There’s her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she’s cheating.

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **If** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""UNDER CONSTRUCTION"". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS"".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

""Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""Stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you.""

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, ""You may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

*Edit edit*: **I am not releasing the videos.**

**Another Edit**: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#Final Edit:

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. 

He *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",True,relationship_advice
647,Update: My (21) little sister (12) was given 1-3 weeks to live. What can I do to make her enjoy her last days?,35806,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5idc1/my_21_little_sister_12_was_just_given_13_weeks_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Final Update:

I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It’s been a very hard couple of days and I’ve been grieving, as has my family. 

We were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she’s in a better place and not in pain. 

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.",False,relationship_advice
648,My (20F) boyfriend (21M) wouldn’t pay for my meal when I forgot my wallet,33920,"Basically the title. 

Usually on dates, we split the bill. I don’t really care like in the past, I’ve paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. Like we’d go back and forth. 

My current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. From the first date, he said that’s how he likes to do things. I was fine with it, I didn’t  really care if he wouldn’t pay for me. Paying on a date is sweet to me and I like it but I have my own job so it’s whatever. I figured maybe he doesn’t have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

Anyway I didn’t really have any problem with it. But we went out to some random spot. Like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. So he went down the line and he got his own meal. I ordered mine and then when I went into my bag, I realized I forgot my wallet at my house. I told him that I forgot it by accident and I thought he’d offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like “oh that sucks...” and sat down to eat. 

I was just like what the fuck..? This guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and I paid him back through cashapp. After we ate, I lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city. 

How messed up is that? Like why is he so cheap. A random stranger paid for me and he wouldn’t",False,relationship_advice
649,UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend’s (27M) phone.,33906,"It’s been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I’m still trying to work through all of your PM’s because I’d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it’s my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don’t. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn’t know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don’t know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he’d admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn’t think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend’s phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don’t have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn’t able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn’t seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David’s phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we’d been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable’s car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn’t want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I’ve never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach’s acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn’t know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said “That isn’t me, that isn’t me, this isn’t who I am” and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn’t slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don’t recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn’t use my internet to access it but I don’t really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn’t sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he’d done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don’t know how long I stared at my TV screen that said “Are you still watching: Planet Earth?” but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn’t know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn’t capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn’t sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that’s what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I’ve been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he’s found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I’ll continue working on replying to your PM’s, but in the meantime I think I’m going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

Bill Nye the Science Guy was entertaining and educational. Bill Nye Saves the World is neither. In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side. To make things worse he does this in the most boring way possible in front of crowd that honestly seems retarded. He doesn't properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.

I just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as ""only eating meat"" which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.

In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because ""nobody wants it."" Really? That's his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don't want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.

In the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn't reduce the acidity level of a solution. He dismiss the fact that vinegar has been used to treat upset stomach for a long time. How does vinegar treat an upset stomach? Does it actually work, or is it a placebo affect? Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don't know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn't change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy). A healthy diet and exercise will help prevent cardiovascular disease, and will help reduce your blood pressure among other benefits. So obviously there is some reasoning behind some alternative medicine and practices and to dismiss it all as a whole is stupid.

I just don't see the point of this show. It's just a big circle jerk. It's not going to convince anyone that they're wrong, and it's definitely not going to entertain anyone.

Quote:

""After posting his apology, ""HanA**holeSolo"" called CNN's KFile and confirmed his identity. In the interview, ""HanA**holeSolo"" sounded nervous about his identity being revealed and asked to not be named out of fear for his personal safety and for the public embarrassment it would bring to him and his family.

CNN is not publishing ""HanA**holeSolo's"" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.

CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.""

740,[OC]Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? A study,22859,"In the Chicago Bears roast thread, 69memelordharambe420 posted ""There are more Bears than Bears fans."" That got me thinking: Is that true? And more generally, which teams have fewer fans than there exist whatever they're named after?

To start, I needed a rough estimate of the number of NFL fans in the world. This turned out to be difficult to find. I found several reasonable estimates that ranged from 200,000,000 to 400,000,000, but the average estimate seems to be about 300,000,000, so I decided to go with that. If you prefer a different estimate, you can easily scale all of the final numbers up or down as needed.

Of those 300,000,000, about [90%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/660525/most-popular-nfl-teams-in-us/), or 270,000,000, consider themselves fans of one team in particular. To find out how these 270,000,000 fans apportion themselves among the 32 teams, I used [this page](http://www.trackalytics.com/the-most-liked-nfl-teams-on-facebook/page/1/), which lists how many likes each team has on Facebook (it lists the St. Louis Rams and the San Diego Chargers but still has accurate numbers for the Facebook likes, I checked), and calculated the total number of likes across the 32 teams: 91,712,968. Then, I took the number of likes for each team and multiplied it by 270,000,000/91,712,968 (then rounded to the nearest whole number) to get the best estimate that I was realistically going to be able to get for the total number of fans that each team has. Here are my results:

Bears: There are roughly 12,092,476 Bears fans. There are [eight species of bear, plus the grizzly-polar hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bears). I won't go through all of my calculations, but I came up with a final number of 1,148,364. There are more Bears fans than bears.

Lions: There are roughly 5,642,181 Lions fans. The worldwide lion population is somewhere around [20,000](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/). There are more Lions fans than lions.

Packers: There are roughly 16,024,215 Packers fans. I don't really feel like doing extensive research on the worldwide meatpacking industry, but the U.S. meatpacking industry employs about 148,100 and there is no way that there are a hundred times that number outside of the country. There are more Packers fans than packers.

Vikings: There are roughly 6,200,740 Vikings fans. The Viking Age ended nearly a millennium ago. There are more Vikings fans than Vikings.

Cowboys: There are roughly 25,758,315 Cowboys fans. There are currently [less than 9,730](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy#Modern_working_cowboys) cowboys in the United States. Again, there's no way there are over a thousand times more cowboys elsewhere. There are more Cowboys fans than cowboys.

Eagles: There are roughly 8,888,974 Eagles fans. This one was a lot harder than I was anticipating, but there are 60 different species of eagle. Two of the most common are the bald eagle (70,000 in the world) and the most common eagle in Europe, the [spotted eagle](http://www.kotkas.ee/species/spotted-eagles) (40,000 in the world). Based on this, I highly doubt that the average eagle species has a worldwide population of more than 100,000, an estimate which would yield a total eagle population across all species of 6,000,000 (remember, this is most likely a wild overestimate). There are almost certainly more Eagles fans than eagles.

Giants: There are roughly 11,690,931 Giants fans. Giants are mythological creatures. There are more Giants fans than giants.

Redskins: I'm not touching this one.

Buccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccaneer), the term ""buccaneer"" refers specifically to Caribbean pirates of the 17th and 18th century. They're all dead. There are more Buccaneers fans than buccaneers.

Falcons: There are roughly 6,009,462 Falcons fans. The common kestrel (5,000,000 worldwide) and Merlin (1,300,000 worldwide) alone cover this number, according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falconiformes_by_population). There are more falcons than Falcons fans.

Panthers: There are roughly 7,034,101 Panthers fans. ""Panther"" is kind of a loosely defined term, but the genus *Panthera* includes tigers (3,890 worldwide), lions (20,000), jaguars (15,000), leopards (250,000), and snow leopards (6,000). That adds up to 294,890. There are more Panthers fans than panthers.

Saints: There are roughly 11,930,352 Saints fans. For this study, I've only been counting living things, and you have to die to become a saint. Not that it really matters, since the Catholic Church has only canonized about 10,000 people anyway. There are more Saints fans than saints.

49ers: There are roughly 12,383,284 49ers fans. ""49ers"" refers to people who partook in the 1849 California gold rush. The oldest living person was born in 1900. All of the 49ers are dead. There are more 49ers fans than 49ers.

Cardinals: There are roughly 4,279,156 Cardinals fans. There are about 120,000,000 [northern cardinals alone](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/lifehistory). There are more cardinals than Cardinals fans.

Rams: There are roughly 2,327,583 Rams fans. A ram can refer to either a male sheep or a male goat (note to all of the Patriots fans about to make what they think is a super clever comment: just stop). There are over a billion sheep in the world and nearly as many goats. This isn't even close. There are more rams than Rams fans.

Seahawks: There are roughly 11,993,609 Seahawks fans. A seahawk is another name for an osprey, of which there are fewer than 100,000 in the world. There are more Seahawks fans than seahawks.

Bengals: There are roughly 3,517,293 Bengals fans. There are 2,500 Bengal tigers left (to be honest I'm just going to stop posting sources when the information is a single search away because I'm already tired of this and I still have half the league to go). There are more Bengals fans than Bengals.

Browns: There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason. The Browns are named after someone whose last name was Brown. In the United States, there are about [1,552,500 people](http://www.namestatistics.com/lastname/brown) with that last name. The majority of the people who speak English as a first language live in the United States, so it's very likely that the majority of Browns do as well. There are probably more Browns fans than Browns.

Ravens: There are roughly 6,927,791 Ravens fans. [There are 20,000,000 common ravens alone.](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/lifehistory). There are more ravens than Ravens fans.

Steelers: There are roughly 19,179,380 Steelers fans. There are only about 87,000 or so steel workers in the United States, and I'm just once again going to extrapolate and say that there aren't several hundred times more than that outside of the USA. There are probably more Steelers fans than steelers.

Bills: There are roughly 2,533,838 Bills fans. The Buffalo Bills were named after Buffalo Bill, so it makes sense to use the number of people named Bill. There are about [3,002,475](http://www.namestatistics.com/firstname/male/william) people in the United States named William. Using the same logic as we did with the Browns suggests that there are roughly twice as many Williams in the world as Bills fans, so we'd need at least half of all Williams to go by Bill. Especially considering how many common nicknames for William there are, this seems unlikely. There are probably more Bills fans than Bills.

Dolphins: There are roughly 6,637,669 Dolphins fans. I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but we don't really have much of an idea how many dolphins there are in the world (the ocean is, like, really big). My standards for reputable sources have fallen so far at this point in this regrettable project that I'm just going to use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-many-dolphins-are-there-in-the-world-1), where ""Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast"" believes that there are well over seven million. So there are probably more dolphins than Dolphins fans. Whatever.

Jets: There are roughly 5,824,758 Jets fans. Apparently, there are about 20,000 commercial airplanes in the world. A lot of those are not jets, but there are also a bunch of private jets. Either way, there's no way the number of jets is in the millions. There are more Jets fans than jets.

Patriots: There are roughly 20,653,722 Patriots fans. A [Gallup poll from last July](http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx) found that 52% of Americans are proud to be Americans, so there are way more than twenty million people in the U.S. who consider themselves patriots, which is good enough for me. Yeah, we've had an ugly election since then but considering that the president still has an approval rating in the 30s, there's zero chance that the percentage of Americans who are patriots is less than 10%. There are more patriots than Patriots fans.

Colts: There are roughly 6,689,254 Colts fans. A [Colt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)) is a male horse under the age of four. There are 58,000,000 horses in the world. The lifespan of a horse in the wild is about 15-20 years (we'll take an average of 17.5 years) and I do not feel like doing in-depth research into the horse industry so I'm just going to assume that the 58,000,000 horses are distributed evenly by sex and age. That would mean 29,000,000 male horses, of which about 6,628,571 would be under the age of four. This is ridiculously close, but using my obviously extremely accurate numbers it looks like there are more Colts fans than colts!

Jaguars: There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87. As I said earlier, there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world. There are more Jaguars fans than jaguars.

Texans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.

Titans: There are roughly 2,737,981 Titans fans. Titans are mythological creatures. There are only 26 of them anyway. There are more Titans fans than Titans.

Broncos: There are roughly 13,082,453 Broncos fans. A bronco is apparently just a name for an untrained horse. The vast majority of the world's 58,000,000 horses are domestic horses, and I'm just going to assume that most of those are trained because I don't know why they wouldn't be and also I am extremely sick of looking all of this stuff up. It would be convenient if Reddit had an option to save drafts of posts but it doesn't appear to. Anyway, the vast majority of horses are not broncos, so that means that there are probably more Broncos fans than broncos.

Chargers: There are roughly 4,700,430 Chargers fans. The Los Angeles Chargers [don't seem to have been named after an actual thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers#1960.E2.80.931970:_the_AFL_years), so I'll improvise. I own several chargers. So does everyone I know. Considering how ubiquitous electronic devices are, there have to be billions of chargers. There are more chargers than Chargers fans.

Chiefs: There are roughly 4,568,973 Chiefs fans. [Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief) is an honorary title used by a lot or organizations, but do they combine to account for one out of every 2000 people or so in the world? I doubt it. There are probably more Chiefs fans than Chiefs.

Raiders: There are roughly 10,099,869 Raiders fans. Meanwhile, a ""raider"" isn't really an actual thing. It's pretty much only used for sports teams. There are more Raiders fans than raiders, I guess.

**Summary**: So the teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are:

Atlanta Falcons  
Arizona Cardinals  
Los Angeles Rams  
Baltimore Ravens  
Miami Dolphins  
New England Patriots  
Houston Texans  
Los Angeles Chargers  

Make of that what you will.

1050,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,146518,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",False,Music
1051,"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and especially the music we all love.",100372,"Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services or watch music videos -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels, stifling independent voices

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

1135,PSA - The Sun will now be a banned source on this subreddit.,40021,"&#x200B;

From now on The Sun will no longer be a source allowed on the sub.

The Sun as a publication has been boycotted by 70 sets of fans of English clubs over the coverage of Hillsborough and other pieces of coverage. Clubs themselves have also joined in this protest by banning the publication from conferences.

We firmly believe that nothing of value will be lost here. The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead.

This ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria. The reliability and content quality of sources should still be governed by the community using upvotes and downvotes.

1208,How do you repair relations with crows?,33666,"Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

Anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

He was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn’t able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

I wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? 

I told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn’t even know what happened, but reading online I don’t know if that’s true. 

I’m crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. 

Edit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

With it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn’t. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don’t know if I can.

This is dangerous. What can I do to notify her parents ?  It is an ATT number. Should I call them? 



Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that’s all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number.

1225,I got promoted while shopping at a store I don't work at.,43515,"So yesterday I was at my favorite local supermarket. I've been shopping there pretty much once a week for the past 6 years. I know the place like the back of my hand. I know most of the employees by name (I live in a small town of ~4000 people).  

As I'm standing in the taco aisle, trying to decide exactly how hard to punish my bathroom later (I picked Ghost Pepper salsa, so a lot), I am approached by a woman who must have been 75 if she was a day. SL will be sweet lady, and M will be Me. 

SL: ""Son, can you help me locate the aluminium foil?"" 



M: ""Sure, it's right up this way."" 


*walks her to aisle 7b*  

M: ""It's pretty high up, let me grab it for you. Do you want the Reynolds, or the store brand?"" 

SL: ""The name brand please.""  

*hands her a 200 foot roll* 

M: ""Do you need help finding anything else? I'm a walking directory of this store."" 

SL: *Hands me her shopping list* 

I spent about ten minutes filling her cart with heavy/hard to reach items, and then I got back to my shopping with a smile and a ""have a great day"".  

As I'm standing in the checkout, I see the SL arguing with the floor manager (Greg, he goes to my church, we're pretty familiar with each other) over by the express line.  

I pay for my groceries, and walk over to be nosy, and maybe help out. 

SL is telling Greg that ""The big guy with the red beard"" helped her, ""I didn't get his name"" and she wants to see him get a bonus, promotion, or employee of the month, something. 

Greg is insistent that no one with that description works there. 

I get to the counter, and before I can explain that I don't even work there, Greg pipes up.  

G (to SL): ""Oh, you mean Mark? Yeah, he's one of our best employees."" 

G (to me): ""Mark, this lady has been over here singing your praises for the past 5 minutes. I didn't even know you were working today."" 

Me (Lying through my teeth): ""Well, Sharon (a cashier I know) called me and said we were slammed, so I came in on my day off."" 

G: ""Well that's some real initiative, how would you like to be Assistant to the Regional Manager (we're both huge Office fans)?"" 

M: ""Oh my God, thank you! Are you sure?"" 

G: ""Well, you've definitely earned it."" 

SL: ""See, this is why I shop here instead of Walmart, even though you guys charge more. You care about your employees, and your employees care about your customers.""

Names changed to protect identities

Listed buildings - Important to the story. In the UK there is a system for preserving ancient and important buildings. If a building has historical importance it is known as a ""Listed building"" and the rules about how it's developed/maintained/improved are VERY strict.   

I need to be vague about the work involved otherwise it's too easy to identify the parties involved.   

My friend David is skilled in a very niche area of construction. He repairs and renovates buildings using a very old construction method that hasn't been common for several centuries. All his work is on conservation projects and ""listed buildings"".   

Work was required on a Grade 1 listed property.   

The overall building work was being done my the main contractor ACC Ltd. One part of the work is VERY specialized.   

The contractors managers didn't know anyone who did it so the architect gave them a list of qualified people. The contractors chose my friend because he had the earliest availability.   

5 days into the work the owner of ACC Ltd, the main contractor company, arrived on site. He was throwing his weight around and being a ""noisy gobshite"" (David's words). David was just doing his job and ignored him.   

Noisy gobshite told one of his carpenters to get him a coffee. The carpenter disappeared.  Noisy gobshite continued wandering and ""gobbing off"" about delays ""costing him a fortune"".   

15 minutes after the carpenter had disappeared the Noisy Gobshite asked my friend a question.   

Noisy Gobshite : ""Where is that fucking chippy with my coffee?""   (Chippy=carpenter)

David: ""Don't know""  

Noisy Gobshite: ""Go and find out""  

David: ""I'm only here for this job (pointing to the walls) I don't work for ACC Ltd""  

Noisy Gobshite: ""I don't give fuck whether you're an employee or a subcontractor, you still work for me. Now go and find my fucking coffee""   

David: ""Firstly, I don't appreciate being talked to like that and secondly, my contract with you is to do these walls, nothing more. I'm definitely not a gopher""   

Noisy Gobshite : ""Oh, you don't appreciate being talked to like that, do you? Which subcontractor do you work for?""   

David: ""None. I'm self employed. It's just me""   

Noisy Gobshite : ""A fucking day labourer? And you've got the nerve to talk to like that? Do you know who I am?""   

David: ""Yep""   

Noisy Gobshite : ""Well you're fucking fired. Get off the fucking site NOW!""   

David: ""Ok, put it in writing""   

Noisy Gobshite : ""Fuck off. Just get off the fucking site""   

David pulled his phone out and started recording.  

David: ""Ok,  I'll go. I just want proof you told me to go""   

 Noisy Gobshite grabbed David's hand holding the phone and screamed into the phone   

Noisy Gobshite : ""GET OFF THE SITE YOU FUCKING IDIOT. YOU'RE FIRED. IF YOU'RE STILL HERE IN 10 FUCKING MINUTES I'LL HAVE YOU FUCKING THROWN OUT""   

David: ""Cool, no problem""   

He picked up all his kit and walked away. As he was leaving the contractors site manager passed him (ironically with a coffee for the boss) and with a smile said. 

Site Manager: ""You leaving early Dave? Bloody part-timers(joking)""   

David: ""No, your boss just fired me. Our contract is ended. Sorry mate""   

Site Manager: ""Noooo. Noo, no. Let me sort this out. Wait, please. Please,wait.""  

David left.

The Site Manager was losing his shit because he knew something that Noisy Gobshite  didn't. Only 7 people in the UK are qualified to do the work. They all have a waiting list and David had been the only one available.  

By the time he was home he had 12 missed calls.   

That was Thursday. 2 working days missed so far. He said he'll go back but only if he gets paid for the extra days and has a genuine apology in person from the boss.   

I met my friend when he was getting a call from the Site Manager saying the boss apologises but is ""out of the country"" so can't apologise f2f.     

David also told me he phoned the other specialists to warn them but they'd all been phoned on Friday begging them to do the job. Nobody took the work. They're all booked solid.  

David also phoned the architect to warn him. Situations like this some unscrupulous contractors try to bodge the job and fake the work.   

David is going to stick to his guns. Pay for all missed days plus f2f apology. He is sure he'll get it. I've said I'll pay ***anything*** to watch the f2f apology

**Update**  
Site Manager phoned to say he was told by Noisy Gobshite  to threaten legal action if David doesn't finish the job. David reminded him he didn't leave and has proof that he was fired.   

Site Manager phoned again to say Noisy Gobshite will apologise f2f on Friday. Can David start tomorrow? David said no.  Following the threat of legal action the conditions are different.   
1. f2f apology before work restarts.  
2. Added pay for wasted days.  
3. Payment of full contract value upfront before work starts.   
4. All must happen by Thursday.   
That's the last day he can start and still expect to finish before his next booking. If he also works the weekends he has just enough time.

I asked him why he isn't charging a huge extra amount for the guy being such a wanker. He said it doesn't look good if you take advantage of companies when they're under time pressure. ""Not the done thing"".   
It seems that one of my friends is an eighteenth century gentleman.  

**Correction**   

I misunderstood David when he said only seven others do this work. He meant seven other businesses apart from his. They're small businesses so he says it's probably about 20 people who can do it. Still a small number but not as comically small as seven. Sorry for misleading you all about the number.   


**Update Two**

Unfortunately it seems there will be no apology. David has discovered that the Site Manager was blamed for ""not making Noisy Gobshite aware of the situation beforehand"" and was fired.   

David contacted the operations director for ACC Ltd (Noisy Gobshite's number two) and informed them that an apology is no longer required as he will not be returning to the job. The Ops Director apologised for everything and offered to renegotiate the money ""very generously"". David told him that he had only considered going back to the job as a personal favour to the original Site Manager. Since he isn't there he feels no obligation to return. Ops Director said he will get back to David but didn't say why.  

I asked why he didn't say ""give him his job back or I won't come back"". David said  ""Noisy Gobshite is too petty and weak to be told what to do by a craftsman. It will have to be the company's idea for the Site Manager to come back. If I *tell* them to bring him back it won't happen"". David says the Site Manager is great at his job but is only 4 years from retirement so it's not easy to find a job at 61.

1227,I'm a teacher. Give me back my phone.,29616,"This happened a few days ago. Sorry for the formatting, I am on my phone.

I work as a substitute teacher at various local highschools, I am 24 but obviously look younger according to this teacher. 
AT = angry teacher. Me = self explanatory.

AT: ""why aren't you in uniform? And no phones during school!""

I thought he was talking to a student so I ignored him.

AT: ""Excuse me, don't ignore me."" He said as he snatched my phone out of my hand.

Me: ""What the f**k, give that back, I'm not a student.""
AT: ""thats detention for swearing at a teacher, you will get your phone back at the end of the day, now you will come down to the office and tell the principle about how disrespectful you are being.""

By this point I thought it would be funnier to let him complain to the principal who I play netball with and watch his reaction. He was raging. Saying I deserved to be suspended and that students always had their phones out yada yada. The principle and I were just trying not to laugh before she told him I was a teacher too.

1229,Some assembly required. Good luck.,25900,"On mobile so apologies for any formatting issues.  First post as well.


This happened several years ago.  I was the night time charge nurse over the ICU.  I’d just finished a 12 hour shift at my hospital that had turned into a 14 hour shift because of a rapid response right before shift change.  (Patient responded well). I was exhausted and had to return for a 4th shift in 9 hours.  All I wanted were some items to drop in the slow cooker so I’d have something to eat when I got up tonight.

I stopped at a well known big box store that sells groceries, clothes, electronics.. the works.  

I’m wearing royal blue scrubs, a name badge with a big RN under it and forgot to take my stethoscope off so it’s hanging around my neck.  The employees here... well... don’t.

As I’m walking towards the store I see an elderly couple struggling to load a large box in their SUV parked at the front of the store.  And I mean old. 90+ Shaky hands. Teetering around with limited mobility. The kind I see with a med list 3 pages long...   no way would his hips take the weight without snapping... and I’ve worked enough tonight.

I approach quickly and address the female half of the couple offering help.   It was gladly accepted and I got their TV loaded with very little difficulty. It was more cumbersome than heavy.  I’m chatting with the woman who is explaining it’s a gift for their son and her husband hadn’t wanted to wait for help.  (I’d wondered why an employee wasn’t helping.). That’s when it happened. 

I will be RN.  She will be EB for entitled bitch.

EB:  hey.  Hey!  

Startled, We stop our conversation and look over.  It’s a lady in her 50s dressed in a cheap looking beige pant suit with a get your manager hairstyle standing about 15 feet away with a hand on her overly broad hip.

EB:  IF you are ABOUT done. I need help over here.

She then points to her cart with two boxes of bookshelves.. some assembly required. I realize she thinks I work here.  

RN:  Oh Sorry.  I don’t work...

EB:  You are already making me late! Just get it done!   ...and DON’T scratch my paint up.

The elderly lady and I exchange looks of disbelief and I try again. 

RN:  I don’t work he...

EB:  Just get it done! 

She then steps away from her cart to grab her purse grumbling about “Fucking idiots” and is digging for her keys when the cart rolls further away and one wheel goes off the curb.  The entire uneven load causes the cart to topple over.  I instinctively jump forward to try to prevent everything from falling...  

I was unsuccessful.  EB, who has now turned to see her particle board bookshelves spilled out on the cement. Corners of the boxes crushed and one has torn open with a few pieces and packaging now exposed.  EB completely loses her shit and becomes a raging thunderc*nt.

EB:  What the fuck!  You fucking moron!  Pick them up!  God dammit.   Fucking...  I’m going to have you fired!  You owe me new bookshelves! And I’m late!

At this point. I’m done.

RN: Pick them up yourself!  I  Don’t  Work  Here!

I then turn to go inside when I feel her grab my sleeve and try to yank me around.  I jerk my sleeve out of out of grip and turn to face her now violently red face.  She opens her mouth to start screaming again but I put my finger in her face and say... 

RN:  No!  Don’t touch me!  Shut the hell up!  I do not work here, and even if I did.  I’d quit before I help you clean up your shit!

EB stands there speechless.  Mouth opening and closing. Sputtering in shock that I’ve dared raise MY voice at HER.

That’s when the manager and an employee come out.  As EB sees the manager and finds her voice. 

EB:  Are you the manager?  This man damaged my bookshelves and is refusing to pay for them.

I just stare in shock.  Seriously?!  Having realized that a man in bright blue scrubs with a stethoscope and a big RN badge really doesn’t work here. Instead of apologizing, she chooses to double down on the craziness and now accuses me of breaking her stuff.

Before I can voice my denial the elderly gentleman I’d helped earlier steps in and explains the situation to the manager.  EB is still voicing complaints but the manager realizes the real situation and apologizes to me and the couple.

I’m still standing by watching angrily as the manager deals with EB and inspects the bookshelves.  They are not damaged. He offers her two new boxes but EB is now done with the whole situation.  She says no. She’s already to late because of me.  Just glares over at me and says to the manager

EB:  Just load them. I’m already late enough because of this!

The manager and employee then lift the boxes up and get them wedged into the ladies car.  

As I shake my head and go to enter the store I’m stopped by the elderly lady I’d helped earlier.

Lady:  Sir.  Thank you so much for helping us with the TV. I’m so sorry some people are so rude.

She then reaches for my hand to shake.  As she folds both her fragile hands around mine, I can feel something in her palm she’s giving me.

Lady whispering:  Don’t look yet. Wait till she leaves.

I slide the package into my scrub pocket and Lady walks away.  EB then gets in her car and (without apologizing or thanking anyone) peels out and drives away.  

I finally enter the store to grab my food items and when I reach in my pocket I pull out a plastic bag with a bunch of screws and hardware. 

I realize immediately that the sweet little old lady took advantage of the commotion to steal the hardware out of EB’s ripped box.

I couldn’t believe it.   I had the biggest grin on my face as I did my shopping.  And I have a new petty revenge hero to idolize.

1230,Entitled old woman grabs autistic kid.,25291,"This story is kinda different, in the way that I (employee) witnessed a autistic young man, ( maybe 14years old) get caught up in some crazy lady Idwhl situation.


Let me set the scene for ya,


I, working as door greeter watching out for lost Customers and folks with returns, working in lawn and garden section, I see this autistic young man ,( I guess he is autistic, as he seems predominantly focused on his action and kinda has the actions of an autistic individual.)


This young man is sorting and moving potted flowers around putting them in a very specific order, matching colors, size of pots, and height of the flowers themselves, ( doing an amazing job at it too I may add.)


He is bothering noone and most folks are just noticing him doing a bang up job,
But this one old crone of a woman sees him ""working"" she stands behind this young man arms folded and tapping her foot, (at first I was thinking maybe it was her son or someone she was shopping with, but the next thing she did proved to me I was mistaken.)


She clears her throat in that dreaded fashion we all know, "" ahem...excuuuuuuuse me You need to help me.""


The young man pays her no mind, continuing with his task, she doesn't like this, she clears her voice and replies louder,. YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME, YOU ARE GOING TO HELP ME NOW!!!.


Before I can walk to her and ask her what she needs she reaches out and grabs this young man by the right arm just above his elbow, I guess the sudden action of this and the young man's condition caused him to spin around and jerk his arm away from this lady, and the sudden movement startled the old woman causing her to step backwards and lose her balance causing her to sit down on her butt.


(It was like in slow motion watching her go from standing to sitting on the ground)


By the time I reached the young man to see if he was ok, his mother had shown up and was asking what had happened, before I could say anything the woman who had caused this was up and berating this young man. Saying he attacked her and she will have him fired and arrested, meanwhile this young man was almost crying and his mother was shocked.


I told the mom to take her son and calm him down, that he has done nothing wrong and just make sure he is ok.


Crazy old women didn't like that I took his side, she began to lie and tell me she was the victim and she didn't do anything, that the employee (young man) attacked her.


I told her not so kindly 
1. she was a liar and I had witnessed the whole incident
2. The young man you forcibly grabbed does not work here and you assaulted him.


By now a crowd has gathered, and the crazy woman has noticed that noone is giving her looks that they believe her side of the story.


She just puts her head down and walks quickly out the store.


When I turn to check on the young man and his mother She was smiling at me and was thanking me for my help, she shops here regularly and the young man likes to arrange the flowers, it's calming to him, I express my regrets about the whole incident, the young man walks over to me and Pats my shoulder once and goes back to the flowers, the mom informed me that was the equivalent of a high five from him.


That was it, then they were gone.

1231,"She wanted to speak to my manager, so I called the person who manages my life.",21946,"This happened yesterday, I was in Canadian Tire, for all of you non-Canadians It's like a mix between a Wal-Mart, a home depot, a bass pro shops, and an auto shop. I was wearing jeans and an old red polo shirt. The employees there wear black pants and a red polo with a triangle and maple leaf logo on the chest.

I was getting wipers for my car because mine aren't clearing the rain off my window anymore... It's a riveting story.  

They have this touch screen thing there where you select the vehicle and it tells you the specific sizes you need for each wiper and brand. I was fiddling with the screen and going through the different sizes and makes of wipers and reading reviews on each one (I research everything before I buy it, drives my wife crazy) I hear someone behind me say excuse me. I think she wants to use the screen to figure out what wiper to buy, so I move to the section that has the wiper brand I'm interested in and start looking for the size I need. 

My assumption was wrong. 

She followed me to where I was now poking through the very badly stocked wipers.

From now on I'll be ME, and she'll be douchecanoe, which I'll shorten to DC. 

DC: ""Why did you walk away from me, that's very rude.""

I didn't even know she was talking to me at this point. So I kept looking at wipers. 

DC: "" This is unbelievable! I'm talking to you.""

I finally click in that I'm the one she's talking to. So I stupidly turn to face her while gripping a 28 inch wiper like a toddler holds a crayon. ME: ""You talking to me?""

DC: ""Yeah you. I need to know what size wiper to get for my Mercedes.""

ME: ""That's what the screen is for."" I said as I gesture towards it with the wiper in my hand and go back to searching for the second elusive 28 incher. 

DC: ""You are terrible at your job, this isn't proper customer service."" She said all huffy.

ME: "" Umm, I don't work here. I'm gonna go back to this now.""

DC: ""I want to speak to your manager right now. This isn't how you treat customers. Ignoring me and refusing to help me, its disgraceful."" At this point she kind of stomps off, but only a few aisles away, and the aisles in the automotive department aren't full height ones, they are like chest height so you can see right across the whole department. She just does a few laps of the aisles around where I am, she's looking all over the place for a manager but not going far, I think so she doesn't lose sight of me. 

ME: ""Still don't work here. So going to be hard to find that manager... and you're not listening to me... ok... "" I say to her and trail off as she's obviously not caring at all. I go back to my wipers.

While she's on her walk I find my wiper and start to head towards the check outs. She chases me down and gets in front of me, trying to stop my escape before a manager gets there. 

DC: ""No! You're not allowed to leave until I speak to your manager about you!""

I've had enough of this buffoon. I pull out my phone and call my manager. I'm self employed, so I call the one person in my life who could reasonably be called my manager. The wife, henceforth referred to as BOSS.

ME: ""I'll call her for you, you aren't going to be able to find her here.""

I put it on speaker phone so the crazy lady can hear. As the phone rings she's giving me this superior smirk like I'm about to get my ass chewed out. 

ME: ""Hey, how's the trip going? (She's on a business trip)

BOSS: ""Great, been having a some excellent meetings with the L3's (VP level people). What's up?""

ME: "" Picking up some wipers.""

BOSS: ""And you're so jazzed about them that you needed to call me in the middle of the day?""

DC is getting really frustrated at this point, I'm obviously not getting to the me getting fired fast enough for her. 

ME: ""Nope, got a lady here at Canadian Tire who wants to talk to my manager. I kind of thought you're the closest thing to that. Want to talk to her?""

BOSS: ""What the hell Labtc?! Am I on speaker phone?""

ME: ""Oh yeah, the crazy lady can hear you, how else is she supposed to talk to my manager? Say hi to the crazy lady.""

DC is finally starting to realize that I don't have a store logo on my shirt, and that maybe I'm not an employee.

BOSS: ""You're such a jackass. I'm sorry ma'am, my husband is an idiot. But he doesn't work there."" I start to laugh at this point. 

ME: ""It's cool hun, she seems kind of slow or something. She probably doesn't realize I'm laughing at her."" I say through my laughter while DC makes some kind of appalled noise from the back of her throat and stalks off. 

I managed to get my wipers and leave the store after that without any further incident. My wife thinks I was mean to her. I say I was fighting stupidity with dumbassery.

1232,How an entitled principle abducted my niece since he thought she was skipping class,21664,"EDIT : a discussion in the comments brought up the idea of epic tales of people getting fired. I keep reading really hilarious stories on this subject in many different subs, like the revenge subs, malicious compliance etc.etc.etc.  so why not give them their very own sub ? /r/youdontworkhereanymorelady was too long, so I decided on /r/youarefired/    

Please help it row by spreading the word, posting storiesm, make comments etc. and if people wanna help mod it, tell me in  a few days when this viral story has died down, or it will drown in all the comments I get on this post.




First a little explanation, here in Germany we have Bundesländer (kinda like the states in the us, but way less independant). Since the school system is up to the BL they often started their summer vacations at different times (the biggest reason being chaos in the highway system if everybody would want to drive to summer vacation on the same day). Also this is not  a recent story but quite  a few years ago.

My niece is from bavaria, i am from baden wuerttemgberg. Her summer vacation started a whole week earlier the ours, and she came for a visit with my brother and her siblings. It was like in the morning and we decided to take doggo for walk and go to the bakery on the other side of the street of a big school complex. I went in, she stayed outside with doggo, Í came back out and she was gone. Let us introduce our protagonists.

PP :principle pissant

Me : take a guess

N : niece.

I decided to call her on the cellphone, and this was the talk.

N : thank god you are calling.....

PP (Screaming in the background) : how dare you take a phonecall while I am talking to you, you are in enough trouble for skipping class....

As I later found out he ripped the phone out of her hand, and must have hung up. I realized what must have happened, and went into the school to clear up this misunderstanding, and go right away to the principles office hoping she would either be there or soon be brought by  a teacher.

Outside I already hear him screaming at her

PP : stop giving me a fake name and stop lying, you won´t get out of here until i have the truth, and I promise you this will be mentioned in your school certificate (we have grades for general behaviour here, and teachers can also write a comment in there. It is something employers care about if you look for an apprenticeship for example).

I did not bother knocking and went right in.

PP : who are you and how dare you just come in here without knocking

Me : I am this girls uncle, what the hell do you think you are doing here ? She does not go to your school !!!

PP : Ah I guess you where the one on the phone, nice try, but you will not help her trick her way out of this. I will get to the bottom of this, and I will only release her to her parents. Now get out of my office or I will call the police and have you arrested for trespassing in a school (school are protected places, so you get in way more trouble here for trespassing then usual)

Me : I will stay right here to protect my niece from your crazy ass, and calling the cops sounds like a really good idea, after all you have abducted my niece.

 So I did the call and just told the police that my niece got abducted and to come to the principles office asap.

PP : do you really expect me to believe your fake phonecall ?
 her un till the police is here
The  he started to shout at my niece again ,who was in tears by now.

ME : STOP FUCKING SHOUTING AT MY NIECE, you will not address her till the police is here, or I WILL shut you up.

PP :that is it, i am calling the police now, to have you arrested and finally find out her real name.

So he called the police, only to find out I actually did call the police. Suddenly he was not so sure anymore, and you could tell the cogs in his head where finally start to turn.

About 5 minutes later the police finally arrived, and they asked us separately. Here is roughly what my niece told the cops.

She was waiting outside the bakery, when PP came unto her like  ab at from hell. He screamed at her that he is really fed up with people skipping school the last week before vacation starts, and will make an example pout of her. Before she could get a word in edgewise, he grabbed her by the arm really hard (hard enough she got a bad bruise for over a week), and that is what started to get him into real trouble. The cops also took her data, and confirmed she is from Bavaria. They then asked us if we want to press charges and I just said throw the book at him. PP heard the police sayíng press charges and suddenly realized he was in real deep shit, so he came over.

PP : hey this is just a misunderstanding, you have to understand I have to be strict with people skipping school.

Me : if by being strict you mean assaulting a  12 year old´so badly she has a handprint from you on her arm that will create a huge ruise, abducting her from my care, and wrongfully imprison her in your office while screaming at her and scaring the beejezus out of her, then no I DO NOT HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT !!!
 
PP : please you are completely blowing this out of proportion, I could get suspended without pay over this,and even lose my job. 

Me : GOOD, anyody who treats a scared 12 year old girl like that should never again get to work with kids.


In the end he really did lose his job, and I am very glad he did. During the investigation it turned out he was a sorry excuse for a teacher, who belittled kids, who always took the teachers side no mater how wrong they where and even had slapped kids on several occasions. He went to court for assault and attempted abducting plus wrongful imprisonment, plus a few more bodily harms against students. He lost job and pension, got 2 years on probation and 500 hours community service with the stipulation it could be nothing that involved kids. He was also forbidden to ever work with kids again.",False,IDontWorkHereLady
1233,I. DID. NOT. ACCEPT. THE. JOB. Now please let me enjoy my holiday,21016,"This happened about 4 years ago when i was looking for work.

My Second Interview was for a 'Marketing' position at a new firm. The interview went well and i was offered a trial shift the following Monday. On turning up it became clear that this wasn't a marketing job but a door to door sales job for what was basically a huge MLM. The 'service' was to sign people up for charities on monthly donations. To make matters worse we were told to lie to consumers about our pay status (we would make a commission effective to their first 2 months donation, my 'boss' would then get another month and the company would get the rest equivalent to 6 months donations). We weren't supposed to tell people that and had to tell them we were salaried (we weren't - i only found out during the trail it was commission only)

So far not so good. When they 'offer' me the 'job' I let them know I have another interview lined up the following day and tell them I'll let them know by the end of the week.

The interview goes well, it's a real (albeit temporary role) and I'm offered the job and inform the MLM of my decision. This is somehow a 30-minute call where he's still trying to convince me to work for him with me saying i'm not interested at all.

Fast forward to the next Monday and i'm rudely awoken at 9:15 with a phone call. I answer to this: (i hadn't saved his number)

Me: Hello Me Speaking

MLM: Where the hell are you?!?!?

Me; Sorry? wh-

MLM: You were meant to be here at 8:30 - this isn't a good start to your first day is it? Why are you so late?

Me: Sorry but who is this?

MLM: It's (not the interviewer) from \*\*\*\*. you know the company who YOU work for, it's too late now your team has left, you better be on time tomorrow

Me: Sorry there must've been a misunderstanding, i got offered a job at xxx and accepted that role, sorry for this.

MLM: well you should have told us this, it's not professional to just not turn up and we would've hired someone else, now your team is short staffed...

me: I told \*\*\*\*, maybe check with him, anyway i need to go, bye

Hoping this is resolved i get up and go about my day. Tuesday morning i am again awoken to the same guy demanding reasons for me not turning up to work (Apparently not working for them isn't a valid excuse)

This amazing continued until the following Monday where i was 'let go' for 'unauthorized' absences.(when asked if this means he'll stop phoning me he told me to grow up and be professional about it)

Think i dodged a bullet there...

My good friend got married last year and invited me to his wedding. I put on a nice suit on, black tie, shined shoes, all that jazz. I didn't realize I was the only white guy there until the ceremony ended. I went ""...huh..."" and thought nothing of it.

At the after party, I also didn't realize the waiters were dressed exactly like me. White shirt, black tie, shined shoes.

I'm walking around and a nice older lady (who would turn out to be the mother of the bride) approached me as I passed her table. She needed an extra seat for her table.

1237,"Karen makes assumptions, grabs a veteran who has PTSD, ends up bruised and arrested",18851,"Long post follows:

Some background before I start: I am in my 30s, have a bit of grey in my beard, and regularly wear my hair in a pony tail. I retired from the military, and after a lifetime of being a non-commissioned officer apparently have an air of ""I know what I'm doing"" even when I clearly do not know what I'm doing. Add to this that my primary job is horse training for dressage, so I tend to dress up a bit due to the nature of my clientele. What this means is that it is very common for me to be wearing slacks, a button-down shirt, and a waistcoat. I get mistaken as management fairly often, though greater than 90% of the time the people I'm interacting with simply apologise and go on their merry way. Every once in a while it goes much worse.

This happened about 3 weeks ago.

I had had to have one of the rescue horses euthanised due to an injury that his emaciated body simply couldn't recover from; and, this happened about a month after my elderly mare (who was the best horse I've ever had the honour of knowing) had passed due to age. Suffice it to say, I was in a funk, but needs must so off to the market I went for dinner supplies.

As I am browsing the shelves looking for an item I can no longer recall, I hear someone clear their throat in the obvious ""give me your attention"" way. Assuming that I am in the way of their buggy, I step closer to the shelves without looking up. Cue a second, louder, throat clearing. I make the mistake of glancing in the direction of the sound.

What I see is a stereotypical Karen, standing behind her buggy, arms crossed, and looking at me very disapprovingly. While I do not recall exactly what was said through the entirety of our interaction, a good portion of it is burned in to my memory. I'm ""me"", she's ""K"" (for Karen, obviously).

K: Now you acknowledge me, I've been standing here for 10 minutes!

Me (rather clueless): huh?

K:  You gonna help me or not?

Me: Well, given how rude you're being when we've just met, I would rather not.

K: How dare you speak to a customer like that?! What's wrong with you?!

At this point, I briefly worry that she is one of my new clients at the stable, but quickly decide that if she is then I can stand losing her.

Me, still thinking she might be a new client, but knowing that I always let them all know to address concerns at the stable directly or via my professional phone number: I'm not working at the moment, so if you've got a problem just leave me a message or swing by the office tomorrow.

K: This needs to be addressed right now! (Unsure of the exact wording here, but this was the gist of it.)

Me: Well, I doubt that.

She proceeds to prattle on about a rude employee who wouldn't get her some item and how it was no wonder since management was the same way. This is the point where I finally clue in.

Me: I believe you're mistaken, as I do not work here.

K: I dont care if you're on break, you're The Manager, do your job!

Me (slowly and deliberately): I did not say I was on break. I said that I do not work here.

K: Yes you do, but you won't for long. Give me your regional manager's number right now!

Me, laughing: Right, I will get right on that for you. Sod off.

She sputters about rudeness and how loyal a customer she is, etc etc. I reiterate one last time that I don't work there, decide that whatever I was looking for is probably unnecessary, and turn to walk away.

This is where she screws up, big time. After multiple combat tours, I don't deal well with large public spaces as it is, and I deal even less well with being pushed, grabbed, pulled, or other very sudden actions directed at me.

She comes up behind me, grabs my right shoulder, and attempts to turn me around. I know she was talking/yelling at the time but I don't know what she was saying. Out of reflex upon feeling the pull on my shoulder, I rotate my arm around hers, trap her hand with my other hand, and step through while pulling. This puts her face first on the floor, and I've got her arm levered behind her with my knee on her back. As soon as I became aware (maybe 2 seconds after the initial grab) I let go, step back, and figure I'm screwed.

She starts bawling about my breaking her arm (it wasn't, there was no actual damage to her except a bruise where her face hit the floor), which causes an employee to come running. He asks if she is okay and what happened. She screams about how she was just asking for help and I grabbed her and threw her down. He looks at me (he knows me because this is near my home and I am there weekly) and I tell him to get a manager and to call the police.

The shift manager arrives before the employee can even take two steps, and asks what happened. As this manager knows me very well (I teach his daughter to ride, and we hang out fairly often), he hears what she says and responds with, ""when the police get here, they can review the security video,"" then asks the employee to escort me to the manager's office until the police arrive.

At this point, I'm figuring that I am well and truly buggered. About ten minutes later, still waiting for the police to arrive, I hear a commotion. Karen slams the door open and proceeds to scream at me at the top of her lungs. The first thought in my head was, ""well, I'm done."" I stand up, square my shoulders, and turn on my sergeant voice.

Me: Quiet you ragged c*nt! YOU assaulted me. YOU grabbed and pulled me. I didn't survive 3 tours of combat just to be treated like trash in a supermarket! Is that how you treat all the people around you, or just the ones you think are below you because they work in a place like this?

At this point, she is silent, and has gone full deer-in-the-headlights like a private who just got off the bus at basic training.

I continue, not noticing that there are now two police officers nearby: Nothing gives you the right to treat people like trash, let alone put your grubby hands on them, you've probably gotten away with it before, it's just your sodding luck to have put your hands on a veteran with PTSD this time. Now, sit the f*ck down and don't open your c*ck holster until someone asks you to!

She sits, quickly and quietly. The officers enter the room fully and I sit back down. One of them takes her out of the office, the other closes the door and asks me for my version of what happened. After I finish, he steps out, confers with his partner, then they speak to the manager and toddle off to watch the security video.

A few minutes later, they walk back in the office. I assume I'm to be arrested, so I turn about and put my hands behind my back, because I do not want to give them any reason to view me as a threat. They then ask if I want to press charges. I turn around, see that they have her in cuffs. They explain that when they came out from seeing the video, she verbally assaulted one of them, then spit in his face when he told her that she could not press charges because she was the aggressor. They were arresting her for assaulting the officer, and wanted to know if I wanted to press charges for her assault on me.

I was tired, I was hungry, and I just wanted to go home. I told them as much, and they left. My buddy, the manager, came in after that and gave me a ride home because I was really in no shape to be driving.

TL;DR - Karen assumes I'm a lazy manager, assaults me which goes poorly for her, ends up being arrested for spitting in the face of the police officer who responded to the scene.

It was a disaster from the start. The managers had absolutely no organization whatsoever. I should have known when they scheduled me for my second interview and the manager didn’t even show up I was screwed. 

Towards the end of the holiday season after Christmas and before New Years, they offered me a non-seasonal part-time position. I was going to accept but they wanted me to work a TON for part-time and being a college student they were not willing to be flexible at all. So I said “nope, I am done after my last day on Jan. 6th”. 

Everything was good after I was done with that train-wreck and I was starting off my second semester. January 20th at 5:00 PM I get a call from Target.

1239,A cam girl thought I was calling for phone sex,18785,"This will be a stretch fit for this sub but it’s a good story.

I used to be a service consultant at a Mercedes-Benz dealership.  A guy in his 20’s just bought an older car & comes in for the first time so I help him out.  I get all his info & create a new customer profile in our database; this takes about five-ten minutes so I usually casually talk to the customer during the process.

I notice he looks tired as hell so I ask him if he worked 3rd shift or something, since it was about 8:00 AM.

He mentions he’s been up all night as a ‘bodyguard’ for his wife - he hands me a camouflage business card with her cam girl name & web address all over it.  He casually mentions “if you ever get feeling a little lonely, give her a look online, she does Skype shows, phone calls & other stuff too.”

I put the card on my desk, he signs the repair order & I verify the phone number I’ll need to call later that day to get approval for repairs.  A few hours later after the technician has diagnosed the car’s problem I call the number & a woman answers...we’ll refer to her as cam girl (CG).

Me: “Hey there, it’s mozilathelaptopkilla from Mercedes.”

CG in a quiet, bedroomy voice: “Did you send the picture?”

Me: “I’m sorry, I’m not sure what you mean.”

CG: “You’re supposed to send me a picture of yourself before we start playing, then maybe we’ll meet up.”

Me: “I apologize again but I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  I started to wonder if I dialed the wrong number.

Right here I realize this is the wife & she thinks I’m trying to party.

Me: “This is mozilathelaptopkilla from the Mercedes-Benz dealership.  I’m calling about your Mercedes-Benz.  Your car needs serviced, not me.”

CG’s voice changes instantly and she starts talking normally. “Oh, so what’s going on with the car?”

He is 6 ft 5 and can look quite imposing even though he really is a teddy bear. Never stressed or aggressive, never overreacting our raising his voice, just a peaceful giant.

So here we are, at the grocery shop, with our 6 mo baby shopping for food and whatnot. It is winter in Canada (so, you know, cold) and we are both wearing our coats. The kid is fussy and nothing really calms him except when we carry him in our arms. It is my turn and my husband is going back and forth gathering what we need and bringing the items to our cart when the banshee-from-hell (BFH from now on) got in his face (figure of speech, she was like 5 ft 2) and started yelling at him.

BFH: ARE YOU DONE? You've been helping her FOREVER and I NEED HELP! NOW!

Husband: But...

BFH: STOP! Don't talk to me unless it is to *thank me*. Are we clear?

BFH: (*smuggling*) GOOD! Now, help me grad the last (item I don't remember, probably some king of condiment) on this high shelve. WHY IN HELL you people always put the stuff I need so high is BEYOND me. Now, chop-chop!

My husband grabs the item, but instead of giving it to her, he keeps it just a tiny bit out of her reach. He looks at it and then at me.

Husband: (*grining*) Honey, do we need (condiment)?

Me: (*catching on*) Well, as a matter of fact, yes! We do!

Lady: WHAT?! HOW DARE YOU GIVE HER MY STUFF! IT'S MY STUFF! GIVE IT TO ME!!!

Super slowly, my husband gets closer to the lady. He is so imposing that she calms down immediately. With the biggest of smile and the most polite voice ever, he says to her:

Husband: Again, I do not work here... but *thank you* for showing me (condiment). We were about to forget it.

And with that, he puts the item in our cart, grabs the baby and together, we left. In the background, the lady howling some profanities. All three of us smiling. I love my husband.

1241,Angry lady really wanted some candy apples.,18543,"So I went to Aldi today on my lunch break from work. I was shopping for ingredients to make hard apple cider. I found the only apple juice Aldi sold without preservatives and loaded up my cart with a dozen half gallon bottles and kept them in their cardboard boxes so they would be easier to transport. There were a few other items I needed to pick up so I pushed my cart through the store shopping for them. A woman noticed the boxes of apple juice in my cart and asked where I had found them. I had nothing better to do, so I walked her over to the apple juice display where she thanked me. Another woman immediately came up to me and asked,

""You used to have these candy apples in the store but I can't find them. Where are they?""

I had no idea where they were so I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't know - I don't work here.""

Her eyes narrowed and she responded, ""What do you mean you don't work here? I just saw you help that other person.""

Now, I am in a t-shirt and corduroy pants and don't look at all as if I would be working at this store. I could tell that this was not going to go well no matter what I said, but I attempted to be polite, ""I'm sorry, ma'am. She asked me where I had found this apple juice so I showed her. I don't actually work here.""

""What do you mean you don't work here?!""

""I don't work here. I am a customer, like you.""

""Just tell me where the candy apples are!""

At this point it was getting weird. ""I really don't know where the candy apples are. I don't work here.""

""You don't know where anything is in this store?!""

""I know where the apple juice is.""

""WHERE ARE THE CANDY APPLES?!""

""Ma'am, I'm sorry I can't help you. I really don't work here.""

""WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!""

""It means that I don't work at this store. I don't know where the candy apples are. I am a customer like you.""

""THEN WHY ARE YOU STOCKING THE SHELVES?!"" She indicated the boxes in my cart filled with apple juice.""

""I am shopping I am going to buy what is in my cart...""

""NOBODY NEEDS THAT MUCH JUICE! YOU WORK HERE AND YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE THE CANDY APPLES ARE!"" At this point everyone around us had stopped and were staring.

An Aldi shelf stocker came over and said, ""Ma'am, the candy apples were a seasonal item and I'm afraid we are sold out.""

The woman glared at the Aldi employee, and then me and said, indicating me, ""WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME THAT?!""

""He doesn't work here, Ma'am.""

The woman then roared in exasperation, pushed her cart into an aisle display of canned food, knocking it over and screamed, ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!! I AM NEVER COMING BACK!""

She stormed out of the store, fuming. The employee gave me with a WTF look, which I returned, then I proceeded to checkout.

I loaded the juice into the trunk of my car and hopped in the driver seat. I checked my mirrors before backing out and noticed that the candy apple lady was in the SUV to my left, sitting in her driver seat, sobbing.

I rolled down my window and waved to get her attention. She noticed me, waited about 15 seconds, then rolled down her window.

""Are you OK, ma'am?"" I asked.

Through sobs and tears she said, ""I said I would bring candy apples to my grandson's party.""

I asked her when the party was to take place and she told me 'tonight'. I told her that I had seen kits to make candy apples over at Safeway, and that if she made them now they should be ready by the time of the party.

Her eyes lit up and she looked at me, ""Thank you.""

""You're welcome.""

&#x200B;

Background: I'm a small chinese woman living in a predominately white neighbourhood. Our house have a large front yard, and we like to do the gardening ourselves. I don't speak with an accent, and I usually use a very English name for easy communication. I called for an free estimate from a local duct-cleaning service, and scheduled it on a Saturday.

My mom and I were in the front yard planting flowers and deweeding, chatting family stuff in our own language while enjoying the nice weather outside.

1243,Armed guard mistaken for store employee. Lady gets arrested.,18125,"So first and for most this is my first time posting to reddit so please let me know how I do.

Now to the story. 

 So I work as an armed guard for armed truck service. For those of you who don’t know, we are responsible for picking up money and checks from other businesses. (I.e. banks,store, restaurants, etc.) As part of my job is handling large amounts of cash I carry a side arm or handgun for those not into guns in order to protect myself and the money. Where I live you have to have what’s called a concealed carry permit to have such firearm outside of work hours, Which I have. 

 So I am on my way home and have to stop at the store to pickup dinner for myself. The store I go to has employees that wear a blue polo and tan pants. My uniform is black pants and red polo with company name on it. And as I had just got off work I still have my name badge on and side arm in its holster on my hip. 
      
 Cue crazy lady. I’m browsing the freezer aisle and she stops me and starts to ask where product z is. She stops dead in her tracks as she sees my gun in it holster. Stops talking and fast walks out of the aisle. I just assume she realized I don’t work there and left to find someone who does. 
       
 I go about my business and proceed up to the cashier line. As I’m waiting to get up to check out in comes a swarm of about 8 police officers. They come straight to me with crazy lady behind shouting “that’s him, that’s the guy with the gun.” They point there guns at me and order my hands up. I drop what I have and comply. I state that I work for company z and that I have a permit for my weapon. 
        
 They lower and holster their guns after the commotion and apologizes for the confusion but said they got a call about a guy walking around the store waving a gun around. I say I’m sorry but since I have been here my gun has been holstered. Never left the holster. 
      
 They turn to the lady and ask if it’s true that I never took my gun out of the holster. She yells that I’m lying and that I can’t have a gun in the store anyway. They of course go and check the security footage and see that I did nothing wrong and let me go on about my business and apologize again for the misunderstanding. 
      
 They then turn around and handcuff the lady who called and told her she is being arrested for misusing the 911 system and inciting panic. Not sure this entirely belongs here and I am open to comments.

1244,Dumb broad took my chocolate milk.,17582,"I was out at a local grocery, just doing a basic food run.

While walking past the milk coolers I grabbed the last two pint bottles of chocolate milk. As I let the door to the cooler close and put the bottles in my cart I notice a rather hefty woman standing a tad too close to me. As I start walking away I hear her say “where are you taking those?” 

Unaware she was talking to me I kept walking. Next thing I know my upper arm is grabbed and pulled. Now for reference, I’m about 6’2”, built like a brick shithouse, and generally a fairly bristly person (so I’m sure my demeanor didn’t help the situation.) At first I just sort of stared at her almost surprised that she had the gall to act this way with a stranger that looks like I do. 

HW: I said where are you taking those?

Me: what?

HW: what are you doing with those chocolate milks?

Me: buying them? 

HW: ok well first off, lose the attitude, and second, I’m sure you’re supposed to let customers have them and not take them for yourself. 

Now at this point I will point out that it took me some time to realize that she thought I worked there because the uniform for this store is red shirts and khaki pants. I was wearing tan pants, a red white and blue flannel, and a brown jacket. 

Me: what are you talking about?

HW: those were the last two milks. Give them to me.

Me: oh fuck off. 

I then walk away a few aisles down to look at soups. I step a few feet away from my cart, so as not to block other people trying to come through the aisle, when  I see movement in my periphery. I figure it’s her and decide it’s best to just laser focus on the soup and ignore her. After waiting for a bit and sensing her leave, I go back to my cart and immediately notice my milks are gone. I’m now in a sort of mood where the next person that talks to me could be Tom Hanks and I’d probably be rude. 

I continue my shopping when the woman comes walking over with an employee, I’m assuming a manager. She shoves a one of her sausage fingers in my face and shouts about how “this is the employee that took my groceries and told me to fuck off. I want him fired NOW.” 

Now that I had realized what was going on I just about lost it:

Me: I don’t fucking work here you moron. 

Manager: woah, hey now.

HW: see what I mean? Fire him. 

Manager: ma’am he doesn’t work here.

HW: then why did he say he did?!

Me: I DIDNT!

HW: you’d better watch your tone my husband is-

At this point the woman was cut off (though I am genuinely curious as to what her husband was. An eggplant farmer? As big of a cunt as her? The world may never know) by another store employee, this one wearing a black shirt and khaki pants, although the shirt had the store logo on it. I believe he was their asset protection employee.

AP: ma’am may I look in your bag?

HW: what? No. Why?

Manager: what’s up Greg?(not his real name)

AP: was watching the monitors, saw her take something out of this guys cart and put it in her bag.

At this point I start laughing. 

HW: (to me) screw you! (To the employees) I was going to pay, I just didn’t want him trying to take them back!

I start to walk up to the front so I can pay and leave. As I get there I notice a couple local police officers walking in and an employee point them offer to the guy in the black shirt who is now walking the woman up front as well. As they walk past me towards a back office I hear one of them explaining to the woman who is now in hysterics that “yes ma’am just hiding them in your purse constitutes retail fraud.”

I then left, wanting nothing more to do with this lady. Moral of the story: play stupid bitch games, win stupid bitch prizes.

I went out for lunch, and decided to have some McDonald's. The restaurant has 2 doors, out of which 1 is closed due being next to a remodeling area inside the venue.

I am sitting across from said door, just enjoying my meal, when an old couple tries and fails to open the locked door. They somehow managed to not see the sign indicating that the door is locked, while pressing their faces against the glass. Old guy spots me, and signals the door. I ignore him and continue to eat.

1246,I’ll Poop Wherever I Like,17030,"This sub is a dream to me. I have experiences like this constantly. I think it might be due to having spent 17 years in the service industry. I just have that look. I’ve started wearing earbuds everywhere I go, but obviously that’s not something I can do in restaurants and bars. 

My buddy was taking me out to a fancy French restaurant as a treat and I was pretty gussied up. I really enjoy getting dolled up and wearing a beautiful dress to enjoy a wonderful meal. However, the city in which I live (Portland, Oregon) has a reputation for diners dressing down, even in fine dining restaurants. It’s a running joke among locals. You’ll go into a restaurant where a couple will easily drop a couple hundo on one meal and over half the room are wearing hiking clothes or yoga pants. I only mention this because the staff tends to be better dressed than the clientele. I was wearing all black with my hair in an elaborate up-do and chandelier earrings. I think the all black is what started everything.

This particular restaurant has a well-known (and frankly down-right foxy) chef who typically works at a station expoing and plating where everybody can see him. It’s also near the door to the only washroom and the server station. It’s a huge restaurant and with only the one washroom, there was a bit of a line. I waited and waited and at one point I think the chef and I exchanged a few pleasantries. When I was next in line a middle-aged man in a Portland-issue plaid button up and jeans got in line behind me. He had cranky energy and was shifting from foot-to-foot. It didn’t seem like he had to go badly, just that he was impatient. I had been waiting much, much longer than him and found his constant sighing and scoffing irritating.

When it was my turn I reached for the door only to have this awful man push in front of me and nearly knock me over shoving himself into the open door. I was so taken aback I just sort of froze and said, “excuse me I was next.” Which is when he wheeled around started YELLING about how he wasn’t about to wait while, “some waitress changed her tampon.” And then yelled at the chef that he should have a staff bathroom, because it’s “disgusting” that the staff use the same bathroom as guests and implied he might not pay for his meal because of it. 

I stood there in absolute shock (and a full bladder) while this man took care of his business. Clearly taking his sweet time out of spite. Maybe. Something about his personality made me think he hadn’t taken a normal shit in years. The chef apologized to me and a waiter who had been at the server station commiserated. 

I decided fuck it. I DON’T work here, but even if I did there is no reason to be treated like I’m not a human. Seriously, dude. You’re wearing muddy Teva sandals and suddenly acting like we’re in fucking Downton Abbey. 

When he came out I used my entire body to block his path out of the bathroom and gave him a stern, but quiet lecture about how a) I actually wasn’t an employee and b) there is nothing wrong with sharing the bathroom with the staff and told him that he had ruined what should have been a special night out. 

Again, this all happened in full view of the entire kitchen staff and several members of the wait staff. I hadn’t realized it at time, but this jerk was actually seated directly next to my friend on the banquet. His female dining companion was sitting next to me. I had been gone easily twenty minutes and my friend was confused and annoyed. I figured at that point I had nothing to lose, so I loudly explained what happened while gesturing to the awful man and making pointed eye contact with the woman. The man looked furious and the woman just silently glared at him.

After a few minutes the waiter wordlessly dropped their check. They were mid-meal and hadn’t been offered dessert. It was clearly a very pointed, but polite, “fuck you, get out” from the staff after his rant. They paid without incident and as they got up to leave he tried to put his hand on her shoulder only to have her jerk away and say, “don’t touch me.” TFW you realize your partner is a complete jackass who got you thrown out of a restaurant for screaming about tampons.

1247,It's a beautiful day for a train ride,16585,"Right so this took place way back in 2007 when I was in my early twenties, working full time at an auto parts store. 

I drove a white 1982 Nissan Pulsar. It was ancient but no complaints. (Relevant, I promise).

It's 7am, I'm driving to work one morning and pull up at a crosswalk to allow a dog walker to pass me.

Without warning, my passenger door opens and a gentleman hops in next to me, nods, says a friendly hello and buckles his seatbelt.

He was a sweet faced, white haired senior wearing a sweater and brown pants. Definitely in his 80's.

I stared in shock and stumbled my words, totally bewildered by what was happening. He saw my expression and said ""Oh! I'm sorry! The train station, please!""

That's when I saw the taxi rank near the cross walk. Taxis here are white but definitely not hatchbacks, like my car was.

He had a big cheery smile and, still puzzled, I realised that the local train station was two streets away from where I worked. I was heading past there anyway. And he didn't seem like an axe murderer so, why not?

I relaxed a little, shrugged and said ""Uh, sure thing.""

We drove off together and he peered out the window, smiling. 

He said ""You taxis are much quicker these days! Ah it's a beautiful day for a train ride, don't you think?""

He looked at me, still with this big smile and said:

""I'm Jerry, lovely to meet you. I'm meeting my friend for breakfast today! I'm so excited. I haven't been on the train in years. All my friends have passed on and I don't really need to go out of town. Well, not until I made a new friend recently. It's funny how life goes isn't it? An old codger like me with a breakfast date! Can you imagine.""

""Oh well that sounds lovely, Jerry. Where are you off to?""

He cheerily described the town he was visiting (an hour away by train) and described the store he wanted to visit while he was there. 

We chatted the whole way and I was so taken by how upbeat and cheerful he was. 

We pulled into the offloading zone outside the train station and he pulled out his wallet. I jumped in, saying ""Oh no charge mate, I don't have my meter working yet.""

(Telling a lie was better than deflating his happy spirit with an embarrassing situation)

He was chuffed. It was a chilly morning. I walked him to the ticket office, where there was a heated waiting room he could sit in until his train arrived.

He thanked me, smiled and said ""It's a beautiful day for a train ride. You take care now.""

""Take care, Jerry.""

It's been 11 years and I often find myself smiling when I remember him.

1248,"Strap in boys/girls this ones a doozy: We don't sell pizza, because you have the wrong number.",16513,"The end result of this story, which I will tell you upfront, is that we lost the ability to order from several local Pizza-Huts ...for lyfe...

Used to we had a phone number that was very similar to a Pizza-Hut, their number was (555)455-5575 and ours was (555)455-5515.  Now these two numbers are commonly mixed up for obvious reasons. This was back before the days of cellphones and everyone having their own personal number, and we actually had to get a caller ID because of this.

For years we had this Pizza-Huts client base call our house (about 50/50 split sober/drunk) and order pizzas. The thing is people WILL NOT LISTEN when you tell them ""Sorry wrong number"" we would have drunk people call back 4-5 times and then begin screaming into the phone ""I KNOW THIS IS A FUCKING PIZZAHUT YOU ASSHOLE!"" or ""GIVE ME THE NUMBER OR I'LL KICK YOUR ASS.""

This was pretty normal and the pizza hut was even aware of this and profusely apologized when we would call them. (Never giving us anything for free though, despite the massive inconvenience of the phone ringing off the hook.)

Well Pizza Hut Corporate then pays for an advertisement on paper, bill-board, and phone book. And guess what? They botched the number they put OUR number on the things for the phone number as one of the locations in our town for Pizza Huts pizza. Why? Because 1's and 7's are the same number apparently.

The phone calls we get FUCKING EXPLODES. It goes from like 3-5 phone calls a day to like 100-200. Initially we were directing people with a message that simply said ""THIS IS NOT PIZZA HUT! THEIR NUMBER IS XXXXXXXX"" It didn't end. We would get calls with people screaming into the voice recording ""I WANT A FUCKING PIZZA THIS IS BULLSHIT I'M GOING TO KILL WHOEVER DOESN'T ANSWER THIS FUCKING PHONE!"" (Aren't boomers great? We got that shit all the time from older people.) I cannot tell you how many times I've been told to kill myself for trying to direct someone to the correct place, and for some FUCKING reason no one EVER listens.

Well upon this happening my Dad calls into the pizza hut and says ""look, all we want is to not have to change our number. If you guys will PLEASE change yours, or pay for ours to be changed (it was like a 10 dollar convince fee or some shit.) we will stop getting your damned phone calls."" The manager cussed my Dad, who had him on speaker phone, calling him shit load of names and for ""getting him bad reviews"" as well as losing customers to his branch, which is locally owned. What a fucking joke. Its costing their business a solid 10 grand EASY over a phone number why not JUST CHANGE IT? IDK.

My Dad looks at the phone, hangs up and says ""Ok asshole, you want to be like that about it?""

My dad then instructs My 17 year old self (and my sister) to take all calls from now on. If it rings pick it up, take the order, and say ""Ok your pizza should be there in (1.5 hours)"" Then when they call back to tell them ""Sorry the driver just left."" and if they call back a third time say ""Well I can get you on the phone with my manager but hes probably going to kick your ass if you keep complaining."" And then switch the phone with someone else and have them say ""Listen here bitch, you aren't getting your pizza and we are keeping your money, fucking get over it.""

Or something along those lines anyway.

Two weeks pass and my Dad tries to get said Pizza Hut to change our number for free. Never pointing out that they fucked up their ad, as apparently they were completely oblivious to this fact. Again the manager screams at my Dad saying ""I don't have the money to change your fucking number!"" We even tried calling OTHER pizza huts to get the issue resolved, and their corporate with no real luck. Fair enough, its game on time now bitch why? For two reasons 1. My dad got a phone with a transfer button and 2. Because summer was rolling around, and me and my sister loved fucking with people over this. It was a really bad influence on us tbh.

We fielded phone calls every day all day long, we had friends come over and they loved partaking in the same thing. We had a general plan:

1. Every other call would get a pizza ""delivery""
2. On the other calls we would get them really pissed off talking shit to them and saying ""Ok do you want to speak with my manager?"" And just cold transfer them to the pizza hut.

It took 6 more weeks of us doing this, and the pizza hut closed. A few weeks before they closed we got a phone call from pizza hut corporate who more or less threatened us with a cease and desist sounded like they didn't really understand what was actually happening as it accused us of ""stealing their phone calls."" LMFAO. We called their corporate and explained what was going on, and even played our recordings of talking with them before about the issue and ignoring us. All they said is ""You had better stop! This is ILLEGAL!"" over and over. We didn't stop. They were aware of what was going on and didn't want to do anything about it because to fix their FUBAR.

A few weeks after the owner lost his job he called our house and was trying to argue with my Dad about how ""bad of a person he was because I lost money, and got my ass beat several times."" ...apparently we had pissed a few people off so bad they actually went in and attacked him and other staff... To this day it cracks me up that a company can be so oblivious, and is the single reason I don't believe we live in anything close to a ""Meritocracy"" anyone in this position who has any merit would instantly change the number, but not a corporation who has money to sue, and not a middle manager who has an ego problem.

1249,IDWH and my husband’s essentially your boss.,15997,"I’m on a burner account, in the improbable event this would get back to anyone involved.

My husband works for a pretty prestigious university as the director of student life. He oversees a decent sized staff, and their work encompasses all manners of student activities, groups, Greek life, etc. 

A little background before I get to ~the incident~, a few months ago we were expecting our baby. Most people on campus knew this, and knew that my husband, let’s call him Joe, would be taking paternity leave. When the big day came, I called him at work and told him it’s go time, meet me at the hospital, and he dropped everything and ran out the door, as you do. In the delivery room we had plenty of down time, so from time to time he checked his work email while I rest. He’s looking through it and goes “what the fuuuuuuu”...

A professor wrote him the most caustic, unhinged rant saying, basically, I came into your office to see you about a matter concerning my students and you weren’t there despite the department hours clearly stating 8-5, this is unacceptable and unprofessional, contact me immediately, etc. He lol’d and said won’t she feel silly when she gets his out of office reply...but no, ten minutes later she’s harassing him again! Finally he sent her a very terse reply and it seemed that was the end of that...but not for long!

Every day for the next week this professor came into the office demanding to know if Joe was there; more than one tear was shed by the staff during this time. I don’t know exactly what she was saying or why no one else could do what she needed (the staff was kind enough not to burden Joe with this while he was on pat leave), but reports are it was like having an angry dementor come through.

On the first day Joe returned to work, he got to meet this professor face to face. He was in his office (on FaceTime with me, actually), when yelling erupts from down the hall. “Uh oh”, he says to me, “bet that’s her.” We hung up and what conversation happened in that office can only be imagined...or maybe he told me and I forgot. #newbornlyfe But by all accounts she was cantankerous, irate, and incorrect in what she was trying to do, and could not be told otherwise. As he is in charge of the department but not of her, he could only put his foot down on the request, but not the behavior. Finally she left and the whole situation was done and dusted, finished and forgotten...but again, not for long!

Fast forward to yesterday. I decided to pop in with the baby to surprise him, and hopefully we could go to lunch. Also show off the baby, of course. When we arrived it was squee!!!!s  all around from the office staff, and one of the ladies took the baby for a tour around the building. I’ve been holding that kid for three months straight so I was happy to let her. 😂 Joe’s admin assistant told me he was in a meeting for another 10 or so minutes, and then she went off on the baby world tour, so I decided to sit in his office and enjoy merciful silence...but, and ya guessed it, not for long.

Enter: the professor from hell. I knew it was her before she said one word. She looked like an ivory tower Karen with an “I want to talk to your dean” hairdo.

PFH: Does nobody do any work around here? This is OUTRAGEOUS. Where’s (admin assistant)? Why is Joe even on the payroll if he is NEVER here? Go find him. 

Me: wut

PFH: Omfg are you too effing hung over to accept simple direction?! Wtf is wrong with you! I’d kick your ass out of class looking like that. I don’t care where he is, GO AND GET JOE.

Me: Oooh, you think I’m a student!

PFH, mockingly: Oh I’m gonna pretend I’m not a student now sitting in the office! with the university sweatshirt! and a bookbag! What group are you in because Joe will be very interested to hear how inept you are.

(I’m like bookbag? Oh yeah, diaper bag lol. At this point I decide to ride this out and hope he comes back and sees it in progress.)

Me: Okay, let’s say I’m a student. Why do you think I work here?

That was exactly the wrong, or right, depending on your point of view, thing to say. This lady came undone in a torrent of maniacal hissing and shrieking. Her vitriol knew no bounds as she directed it at me, the office staff, my husband, all students except hers, the building itself; I’ve never seen such a tantrum (give the baby a few years...).

As she’s having her meltdown, I moved out of the chair where I’d been sitting and sidled up to a photo of our wedding that Joe hung up . I leaned against the wall like a laconic cowboy with my foot up, arms folded, smirking. Unsurprisingly, she didn’t notice the similarities between the beaming bride and the dumpy, sleep-deprived chick standing before her, but I remain committed to the con.

After several moments of a nonstop torrent of verbal abuse (“Joe’s not even fit for community college, how the eff did he get a job here!” was the one that made me chortle; she didn’t like that much), I hear a flurry of footsteps come flying down the hall. The admin assistant comes sliding through the door like Kramer, face white as a sheet. I ask her if Joe Jr is okay (another co-worker had him in another office, because they heard PFH and didn’t want his baby self to learn what madness lurks in the world at such a tender age). She has exactly enough time to answer yes before PFH unleashes the kraken in her direction vis-a-vis the ineptitude of...moi! *clutch pearls*

AA: Wait, what are you talking about? That’s Mrs. Me.

Me, still posed like the Marlboro Man: (points at my picture)

And right on cue, here comes the man of the hour, Joe, complete with Joe Jr in arm. The co-worker holding the baby had called his cell phone and told him what was happening and to get back here ASAP. Joe was livid, but that eerie scary sort that is a schadenfreude-lover’s delight when directed at a deserving recipient. He handed me the baby and asked if I was alright, then turned to PFH.

Joe: Get out. Do not come back until I’ve spoke to your department chair. I’m going to lunch.

Me: Boy do I have a story to tell you. 

And out the door we swept, off to lunch, where were got pizza and migraines from laughing so hard.

At this time I don’t know what action is being taken against PFH, but if asked I will sure be happy to give testimony!!

EDIT: Thank you so much for the silver, friends! And I PROMISE all you guys that I’ll update this every step of the way. I have no idea how long these things take or if they’ll even want to talk to me, but I cannot WAIT to see how this goes down. Also, if you guys run into Joe I never wrote this, you don’t know anything, and this story is certainly not on the internet. 😗🎶

EDIT 2: And gold are you kidding me?! I never even got that on my “real” account. Maybe I’ll start using this one. 😁

EDIT 3: PLATINUM?! Nice knowing you plebs I’m off to hang out with the rest of the landed gentry and try to stay away from guillotines.

🚨 UPDATE 🚨 

Okay. Joe talked to the head of the department of engineering, and turns out PFH is an ASSOCIATE professor from hell, and therefore untenured. Muahaha. Joe is leaving for a conference tomorrow and won’t be back until Wednesday, so I probably won’t know more until then, but stay tuned! 

🚨 UPDATE 2 🚨 

Admin assistant is gathering up a paper trail of literal papers that PFH has submitted that she isn’t allowed to and checks she’s signed that she can’t sign. She’ll also be forwarding all abusive emails from PFH, and making a written statement of PFH’s behavior. Joe will probably send the emails he’s received to HR and the dept chair, but he’s not as heated now (on his own behalf, but still livid about the way the staff are being treated) as he was the other day, and might not press too hard except in support of the staff.

🚨 UPDATE 3 🚨 

Not a very exciting update, but the admin assistant has submitted her complaint to HR. PFH’s department chair suggested to her that she not contact “Joe’s” department, not for the least of which reason the thing she’s trying to do can ONLY be done by students and she overtook their responsibility in an effort to mega-ultra-micromanage them. *Quelle surprise* that she treats her students like that, and usurped control of a student-led group. 🙄

In all likelihood, this process will drag on for some time, and she’ll probably get a slap on the wrist for both offenses. ",False,IDontWorkHereLady

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher).

I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. 

I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. 

I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. 

I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. 

I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. 

The next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. 

I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  

Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.

1278,Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,41616,"Male, late 20’s, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven’t consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter’s car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like “The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby.” As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone’s screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I’m calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn’t get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their “duty” to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",False,legaladvice
1279,"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew",40574,"This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!",False,legaladvice
1280,"I told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.",40085,"I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.

He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. 

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. 

I should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.

Thanks to everyone’s terrific advice, I got my university’s ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school’s general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration’s decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors’ incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I’ll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.",False,legaladvice
1283,My wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! I’m growing very worried,37248,"Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

Title says it all. We’ve been married for 3 years now. She’s always been one for quirky, “against-the-grain” thinking and interests. However, it’s not just harmless things like believing there’s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in “aesthetic poses”, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there’s this anti-vax bullshit. 

She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she’s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. 

I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She’s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

I know that in her mind, she’s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we’ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for <X disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <Y vaccine>”

“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” 

I’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”

I’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”

She won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. 

I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

1284,Update to: Someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when I was underage and I'm terrified that I'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (Ohio),35080,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

So as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.

I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.

Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation.

1285,"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.",34298,"Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!).

So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.

Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them.

They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

EDIT:

Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

FINAL UPDATE:
Hey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.

&#x200B;

So, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200B;

So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200B;

So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200B;

Sorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.

(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.

During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200B;

Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200B;

Turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using ""Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you.",False,legaladvice
1291,Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico? (UPDATE: it's done),30888,"https://redd.it/6m79kf

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",False,legaladvice
1292,[Update] [MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,30652,"I'm updating [my last post](https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

1293,Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,30146,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped.

1294,[UPDATE] Had a falling out with the girl I love and got served a cease and desist order. What can I legally do? [Michigan] (x-post on r/relationships),28423,"Past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",False,legaladvice
1295,Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,28245,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",False,legaladvice

There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry.

It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word.

1303,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,124368,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%.

It is a far-better-worded summary of what I was trying to explain here.
(US ONLY. CHECK YOUR LOCAL AND STATE LAWS. CONTACT AN ATTORNEY WITH QUESTIONS)

This is a common tactic of bill/debt collectors, especially with medical bills (which a lot of people rack up in their final days). Debt does not pass to anyone else upon someone's death. They can get paid from the estate, but, depending on your state laws, they're usually pretty low on the order of priorities. If the estate is insufficient to pay the debt, they're written off. Don't get tricked by these shady bill collectors. You are NOT responsible for your loved one's debt (unless you cosigned for the debt of course).

For example, see Wisconsin's statute below:

(1)  Classes and priority. At the time of their allowance, all claims and allowances shall be classified in one of the following classes. If the applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all claims and allowances in full, the personal representative shall make payment in the following order:

(a) Costs and expenses of administration.

(b) Reasonable funeral and burial expenses.

(c) Provisions for the family of the decedent under ss. 861.31, 861.33 and 861.35.

(d) Reasonable and necessary expenses of the last sickness of the decedent, including compensation of persons attending the decedent.

(e) All debts, charges or taxes owing to the United States, this state or a governmental subdivision or municipality of this state.

(f) Wages, including pension, welfare and vacation benefits, due to employees which have been earned within 3 months before the date of the death of the decedent, not to exceed $300 in value to each employee.

(g) Property assigned to the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner under s. 861.41.

(h) All other claims allowed.

1381,YSK that you can solve cases of child pornography by simply looking through pictures of household items.,32626,"EUROPOL, the European international police agency, has stepped up its efforts to combat child pornography and child abuse. One of the most important ways to do so is to identify and rescue the children and teenagers who are being abused, pressured, trafficked or even raped. The most important thing is to find and shield them from further harm, before the police will search for the perpetrators. Investigators often do obtain videos and pictures fro websites or hard drives, but identifying and finding the victims involved is very hard. They have to deduct the surroundings and people from only a few images. **\*\*You can help!\*\***

[Trace An Object - Stop Child Abuse](https://www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse) features various images of common objects from cases/videos of children being sexually exploited. The pictures of these objects are cut out from the raw material, so it ~~is suitable for everyone and~~ protects the identity of the children involved. This includes clothing, children's toys, books, gardens or even entire backgrounds.

You can take a look on the website and look trough the various images and see if you can help with anything. Do you know where a specific kind of shoe is being sold? Have you been to this certain location? Can you identify the country where this picture was taken? If yes, you can directly give tips and hints to Europol anonymously.

EDIT: Judging from the reactions think I underestimated how gruesome and horrifying the images actually are, so I must warn you: **the pictures include scenes and objects that might be very disturbing**, such as silhouettes of children, baby clothing or personal items.

Reposting here, because I really want to share this useful tip with others.

The idea is to make the voice in your head act as a narrator to things that are happening around you. This turns your focus outwards rather than inwards. Lots of anxiety arises from too much focus on oneself.

Edit: There's a recently coined word that kind of relates to this that I would like to add onto this thread. It goes hand in hand with this advice. It's called ""sonder"": 
>n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

Edit: I'm not saying sondering is another word for this technique of narrating. It's a separate thing I like to do when feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders, or when I feel like the world is out to get me. That can be just as debilitating.

So please, don’t accuse everyone of trying to violate you while struggling. The medical staff is just trying to make sure you’re safe.

A)Obviously not every hospital is going to be like this. I was referring to those hospitals that have obgyn outpatient clinics connected to them, which is pretty much every hospital in my city

1389,YSK: Babies do not shiver when they are cold. If you see a baby shivering it needs to be fed immediately because it probably has an extremely low blood sugar.,27748,"Babies have a major problem with thermoregulation (keeping a normal temperature). Because of this, many people think that when a baby starts to shiver it is cold. That's not true. If your intervention is to try to warm the baby it will more than likely die of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Keep this in mind and it could save a baby's life. 

TLDR: don't try to warm a baby up when it shivers, feed it instead. 

Realizing the magnitude of this post, I must state that this is not a common occurrence. It will likely never happen to your child. There is no need to be frightened as a parent. I was just trying to be helpful. 

Edit 1: Source 1: http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=hypoglycemia-in-the-newborn-90-P01961 (shows signs of hypoglycemia including 'jitteriness, which is often confused as shivering.)

edit 2: better source 2: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726172/ (shows baby's do not shiver to regulate body temperature, I know this study is done on adults but it has great information on non shivering thermogenesis)
Source 3: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446425/  (More great info on brown adipose tissue - the main source of thermoregulation in neonates)
Source 4: not scholarly but relates the sources above.  http://www.sciengist.com/newborn-human-babies-cant-shiver-thats-why-they-have-brown-fat/

edit 3: I probably should have said newborns or neonates instead of babies, basically this applies to those in their first months of life. 
Also, there is more than 1 reason for a newborn to have what seems like a 'shiver,' however low blood sugar will be the case almost all of the time 

edit 4: Added Another source on brown adipose tissue (the main form of neonatal thermoregulation) 

edit 5: cleaned up source list, replaced sources with others that stated the point more clearly.

final edit: Read the sources guys, they aren't stating my point word for word, I recognize that. If you do not believe me for some reason then just google ""do babies shiver.""  I just wanted my sources to come from scholarly articles.

In short, if it's a physical thing that exists in reality, like your fingerprint, you can be compelled by a court to give that up. If it is information, something you know that only exists in your mind, you cannot be forced to give that information up (you can be held in contempt of court, but no technology exists that can extract information directly from your mind) 

Keep this in mind when purchasing and setting up a new phone. Sure someone can beat you with a pipe wrench and hope you crack and give them the information, but you can always choose not to divulge it to them. They can pin you down to a table and hold your hand or your face to your phone and unlock it, but nothing will ever be as secure as a password that only you know. 

""Why does this matter? I have nothing to hide"". I would like to draw your attention to the 2004 Madrid subway bombings. During the investigation into the attacks, detectives found a partial fingerprint on a piece of the recovered bomb casing. This information was forwarded to INTERPOL and the FBI. When the FBI ran that print against their database, they found it matched with a lawyer in Portland, Oregon. The FBI arrested him, raided his home and his office, and charged him with a terrorist attack that killed hundreds. The thing is, this man was innocent. He had never once been to Madrid, let alone Spain. It turns out that there are more people on earth than unique fingerprints. This innocent lawyer in Portland was crucified by the FBI because he happened to be unlucky enough to have the same fingerprint as a Syrian born member of Al-Qaeda. the FBI sent expert after expert after expert to the stands to try to send this man away for life. It was only after the actual terrorist was caught that the FBI finally let the case go, but not before economically and socially ruining an innocent man's life. 

The thing is though, had they of not caught the real guy, they would never have given up the case against this innocent man. They would have gone through every message, every email, every scrap of paper, to try to build any connection, even circumstantial, that could convince a jury this man was a mass murderer. 

This could potentially happen to any of us. If you have months or years of every Google search, every message, every contact, every social media account, every geotag, every picture someome has taken, well you can find plenty of things to cherry pick to build any narrative you please. 

This is why you don't want the police in your phone, even if you have 'done nothing wrong'. They will never use that information to exonerate you, it will ALWAYS BE USED **AGAINST** YOU. Dont give them the chance. Don't use facial recognition. Don't use iris scans, don't use fingerprints.

It's been a surreal day for me. There are articles on blogs and I heard someone talking about me in a YouTube video. 

I've had thousands of messages and comments of support and I'm very grateful. I've had lots of questions too and I've done my best to answer all of them. If I missed yours it's not personal, it's just that my inbox is out of control.

I've had background anxiety all day that I've said something offensive on reddit at some point and someone is gonna find it, but so far so good. That anxiety is of course drowned out by all the good feels.

I've had messages from people hinting that Marvel higher ups are aware of me and are preparing something. 

Also, because Australia is a small place, turns out I know a guy who knows a guy who is chums with Chris Hemsworth. I think they called him tonight on my behalf.

A mod on r/thanosdidnothingwrong asked for some proof so I sent something a little while ago. I think he'll disseminate it to other mods but if mods here want to see something let me know.

I don't know what the outcome will be but this has been amazing. If it doesn't pan out don't sweat it - I'll carry your kind words with me and that's worth far more.

If I do survive until Endgame it's gonna feel strange because I'll feel sorta obligated to die :-P

Lastly, I don't mean to be greedy but since I'm triple dying can we throw Captain Marvel into the mix?

I'm still alive. I've just come out of what feels like a weeks-long dream. I'm on fentanyl and morphine 24/7 now, and it took a while to get the dose right, e.g, find the happy medium between screaming and being unconscious.

I can't cough, sneeze, laugh or burp now without through-the-roof agony, but I'm finding ways to manage these bodily functions to make them less painful. Typing this right now, I'm in no pain at all, and I've been up and out of bed and moving around, so my quality of life is still good.

A recent scan I had (after my pain escalated suddenly) revealed a host of bad things going on, few of which I know anything about yet. Following each of these up is the next step of my journey.

**Edit9:**

They were wrong - it's liver metastases, not lung cancer. They can't be 100% sure because the lesions are in a position they can't biopsy, but they seem confident of their revised diagnosis.

My liver cancer has mutated an immunity to the first-line chemo. There is no second-line funded by Medicare. Fortunately, my doctors were able to apply to the manufacturer for compassionate access to the second-line drug and were successful. I started this new, more hardcore chemo three days ago. 

I'm gonna make it.

**Edit10:**

Tomorrow is the big day. 

I was admitted to hospital last night. While I was unconscious, a doctor asked my girlfriend whether they should resuscitate me if my heart stopped. When she said 'yes', they told her she was cruel and that I'd been through enough already. 

Fuck that guy.

My biggest challenge tomorrow will be making it out of here. I'm going to a 4.45pm session. Remember, if you spoil any part of Endgame, for anyone, I will haunt you, and not in a nice Casper way.

I hope you all enjoy Endgame. With luck I'll be there too.

NO SPOILERS

I fucking made it.

http://imgur.com/gallery/gwK7OKS

It took some ""negotiating"" around the hospital bureaucracy to escape. We told them we were going to see a movie. They granted me a two hour pass before I'd be considered discharged against medical advice. We were gone for about eight :-D.

We had the best seats in the house. I had a bag full of morphine and vomit bags which fortunately I didn't have to use. I was so enraptured with what was happening onscreen that it wasn't until it was over that I realised quite how sick and sore I was.

After the movie we had missed calls from the hospital, but fortunately my room was still empty when I got back. The nurses were a tad cranky. Worth it.

I won't share anything about how much I enjoyed Endgame here - you'll find me participating in the discussion throughout this subreddit. There's so much to talk about, I don't think I'll get bored of it in my lifetime.

Thanks to my crew who held our place in line, got us the best seats, carried me to my walker and matched my enthusiasm for the movie. Thanks to my bb who has been carrying me through life for a long time now, especially in the past week, and especially last night. I couldn't have made it without her, not nearly.

Thanks to Disney for [redacted].

And thanks to you guys - I was buoyed by your support. Every message reminded me that I could make it here. There was a part of the movie that really captured how I felt when you all came out to bat for me - I think you'll know it when you see it.

See you all around!

1503,The FCC Is Blocking a Law Enforcement Investigation Into Net Neutrality Comment Fraud,119530,,False,technology
1504,Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,114346,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",False,technology

I don't really know too much about how college works so when I'd heard online that you had to be accepted into engineering school, I assumed I'd need to take some preliminary classes or something. Much to my surprise, after a long hold on the phone, the lady came back and said I was eligible for engineering school.

I was so stunned I had to ask her again just to be sure. ""I'm sorry, did you say eligible or ineligible?""

I could cry. He'd be so proud to know I'm going to be an engineer. I wish I could have made it before he died. ",False,TwoXChromosomes
1633,My neighbor asked me to stop jogging because her son was watching,55086,"I don’t jog often, I don’t even like running, but last night while walking my dog, I needed to get home before being eaten alive by mosquitoes. I ran up one side of a cul de sac, and by the time I reached the end, a woman was standing in her yard, watching me. I didn’t think much of it. It’s summer and kids are out playing, so parents are usually near by. Then she waved. I waved back and when she motioned me into her yard, I assumed it was so she could ask to pet my dog or something like that. No, instead she told me that I should be more conscious when running because I’m “big chested.” I honestly didn’t know what to say. She said that I was distracting her son, that running might “feel good” but “men would notice and that’s not the kind of attention you want.” 

I walked the rest of the way home after saying nothing to set her straight and feeling stupid. I’ve been a size D since I was fifteen, and wore baggy clothing for years after I heard a boy say “did you see her tits bounce?” It’s the first thing that people notice about me and it never fails to upset me that I’m at fault for other people ogling me. I still don’t know what to say to her but l’m twenty years old, she’s not my mom, and she can’t tell me to stop running, so I won’t.",False,TwoXChromosomes

1638,A coworker asked me for a hug last night.,50948,"I'm a server. I was in the kitchen to clock out after doing a double and fairly new guy from the kitchen asked me for a hug. I said, ""no thank you."" That should have been the end of it. It wasn't.

Instead, he tries turning it into a debate and says, ""well you hugged [other female coworker], you can hug me too! Come on, it is just a hug."" I have learned not to JADE from my Reddit use (thanks Reddit!) so I answer with ""I said 'no' and I meant it."" I then proceed try to walk passed him, ignoring anything else he says but he blocks my way.

He says he will hug me anyway. I stop trying to get passed him, look at him straight in his face and with a polite smile I tell him that no, he will not hug me against my will and if he does try to I will not only punch him in his face but that I will get away with it and he will end up the one fired. 

He gives me a confused look and just says ""No, you would get fired?"" Which is when the kitchen manager (who could overhear our conversation from the prep area) grabbed him, removed him from the time card area, and told him ""Noooo, she's right, you would get fired and she more than likely wouldn't even get a write-up."" I clocked out and left pleased with how I handled myself. 

This morning while I'm clocking in for my shift the kitchen manager asks if I have a second to talk. I say sure cause I'm a little early. He tells me he had a very quick conversation with the new cook about sexual harassment. He said because of the complete lack of understanding on this guys part, he called the owner and set up a mandatory company wide meeting with a specialist to go over not just sexual harassment but consent as well. He said if this guy gives me or anyone trouble to let him know. 

So I left work last night proud of how I handled myself and left today proud of how my employers are handling themselves. This is a meeting I'm actually looking forward to going to. 

Edit: I posted this then went out to eat having 24 upvotes and 3 comments. I never imagined my experience would inspire so many people! Thank you all for further words of encouragement.

Also, huge thank you to the kind strangers who gave me my first ever Reddit silver and gold!

This is my first week at the gym and every night after work, the same three girls are there. Today I found out they have been snap chatting pictures of me and making fun of me, but I don't mind. 

I'm glad that you haven't gone through what I've been through. I use to be in shape, I broke my hip and had to give up all exercise. Then my grandma got sick and I took care of her full time, I couldn't leave her alone because I had no help, so I gained more weight. Then she died, and I ate my feelings and gained more weight. Now I'm a size 22. I don't hate myself, or my body. I love who I am, and that took me my entire life to be able to honestly say those words. I love myself. 

It really sucks that society, and your parents raised you that it was okay to try to hurt someone that's trying to better themselves instead of trying to lift them up but I'm not mad. 
Thank you for reminding me to keep pushing after I had a really long day.
In a month when the new year shit has worn off, I'm still going to be dieting and working my ass off at the gym everyday. It's not so you, or anyone else, will except me. It's for me. 

I hope anyone else, who feels ugly or is over weight and has decided to make a life change will keep going. 

Forget the skinny girls who laugh at you, or the muscly men that tell you you're gross, love yourself.

ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.

Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

Edit: This post got more traction than I was expecting. I’d really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where I am. I grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

They’ve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It’s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It’s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

I guess I can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what’s worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. Most American employers/career help centers I’ve met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won’t go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. Anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

A few people have mentioned LaTeX. I use LaTeX often in my math coursework, but I’m not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. Pages (on Mac) has been sufficient for me.

As far as LinkedIn go, it’s a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper.

1850,"Warning: AT&T applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent",62171,"So over the holiday I received an email with an order confirmation from AT&T (my ISP, and the only one available in my area) and it had a new bill amount (about $5/month higher).

I haven't ordered anything so the first thing I thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. I immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. I had a notification that showed that [AT&T had ""upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge""](https://imgur.com/LrUUetX)

Obviously I was annoyed by this, so I dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. I then found this alert showing that the ""promotional discount"" for this so-called [""customer loyalty speed upgrade""](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. 

I then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J), under the guise of ""customer loyalty"", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. 

I immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that AT&T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.

Make sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. I'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and I don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but I do feel like AT&T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. If this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. This was just the closest thing I could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.

**Edit 2:** Since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!

>I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a “slam sale” in the industry. It’s when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. 

>Oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago, and it’s almost unheard of today. I wasn’t aware that AT&T was experiencing Slam Sales today. 

>You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&T, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. 

>Sorry this happened to you.

And another PM:

>I also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account PIN/Password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts.

All of these companies are regulated — a government agency is paid by your taxes to make sure you’re not ripped off. These companies also rip you off in small amounts in part because they assume you won’t do anything about it. When you complain about it to the government agency that regulates them, they not only fix your problem but if enough people complain, they’ll fix the whole system, which helps other people.

The types of problems could be billing (they overcharge you), service (you’re not getting what you’re paying for), unfair and deceptive practices (you were tricked) or more. All of these complaint systems work in 2 weeks or less and it’s awesome. It’s sort of crazy more people don’t know about them.

>In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.

As always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations. ",False,personalfinance
1853,I made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!,50661,"Hey guys! last year I made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- I'm terrible at sticking to a budget so I made a sheet that breaks it down so that I just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.

[Heres what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)

I grew up very poor and had NO sense of what or even HOW to start budgeting. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. Another problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number.

&#x200B;

The sheet was set up with three goals in mind:

&#x200B;

1. that it be easy to use
2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support
3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before

&#x200B;

So how does it work?

The main budget is divided into three core areas:

&#x200B;

* Income: You use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. If you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- So for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.
* Expenses:  There you can add your expenses. Utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. Bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. Finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. Within your expenses there are TWO areas to which you need to pay attention:-Credit Card Payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. Decide whether to pay the minimum payment OR choose an amount to pay. The tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  Once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-Big Purchase: Use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!
* Budget summary:  Finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- Here you will see just how much you can spend. This money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. As long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. It will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income VS spending is!

&#x200B;

[~~Here is a link to the sheet~~](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCjtrGVKUM7siXilSaqnlHXwemH-QGBEULZBm5bEDMg/copy)

&#x200B;

ou use it like this

* Go in
* Make a copy
* Change the numbers
* Decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved
* Budget.

The sheet includes three charts:

* A bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* A pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* A daily Pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

I don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

1854,Stop Spending Money on Food! -- BUY A CROCKPOT,46162,"**Holy shit at the money people spend on food!**

And I was the exact same way when I landed my first job out of college.  You know what I'm talking about--biscuit and Starbucks on the way to work, lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  Every night!  All week!  Professional money spender!  And more beers and dinners on the weekends!  Woohoo!

Wait.  Where did all my money go?  And how the hell did I gain 40 pounds in six months?  If you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-I-can trap.  And you have to stop it.  It's killing your bank account, it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (Literally--I was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)

**What you know you need to do: *STOP EATING OUT***

But how??? How do I stop eating out???  Fast food is *soooo* good!  And cooking is *soooo* hard!  Well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  You're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....

>Crockpot.  It's the crockpot.  Crockpot.  Crockpot.  Maybe you call it a slow cooker, but I'm from Georgia and here it's a crockpot.  

***!STOP!***--If you do not own a crockpot I highly recommend you go buy one from Amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!

Get one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *JUST GOOGLE IT CAUSE MODS DONT LIKE LINKS!*

**BOOM!**  $39 investment.  We're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  Are you ready?  We're going to make enough food for dinner *AND* left overs for lunch.

I'm going to give you some of my super-secret-I-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  Yes.  The crockpot makes *all* of those possible.

**MEAL 1: Thick Cut Porkchop with Potatoes and Carrots**

>Servings: 4

>Ingredients:

>1 Can Beef Broth (50 cents)

>1 Packet Brown Gravy Mix (50 cents)

>1 Packet Onion Soup Mix (50 cents)

>1 Package of 4 Thick Cut Porkchops ($7)

>6 Carrots (50 cents)

>4 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)

>Sack o' Salad ($2)

>Total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.

>Spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  Add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  Place porkchops in broth.  Chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  That's it.

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home make your salad and dig in.  Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**MEAL 2: Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup**
>Servings: 4

>1 Pound Italian Sausage ($4)

>1 White Onion ($1)

>1 32 Oz Box of Chicken Stock ($1.50)

>1 Bag of Prewashed Kale ($3)

>3/4 Cup Heavy Cream ($1)

>5 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)

>1 Head of Garlic ($1)

>Total cost: About $14/4 = 3.50 a serving

>Brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  While meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  Add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (I get two recipes per bag of kale).

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**MEAL 3: Super Awesome Easy Chili**
>Servings: A Lot (6-8?) -- I eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  Stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)

>3 Cans of Black Beans ($2)

>2 Cans of Hot Chili Beans ($1)

>2 Cans of Red Kidney Beans ($1)

>8 Cans of Diced Tomatoes ($6)

>1 Pound of Ground Beef ($4)

>1/2 Cup of Chili Powder ($1)

>1/4 Cup of Garlic Powder ($1)

>1/4 Cup of Onion Powder ($1)

>3 Tablespoons of Cumin ($1)

>3 Tablespoons Black Pepper ($1)

>Edit: The spice proportions are correct!  This makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7L).

>Edit: Salt to Taste($1)

>Total cost = $20/8 = About $2.50 per serving

>Drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  Brown the ground beef.  Add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.


It's easy guys.  It's really easy.  You spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a LOT of money!  AND ITS GOOD FOR YOU! (better than Wendy's--that's for sure!)  AND ITS EASY!

**Stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  I am much happier and much wealthier!**

EDIT: For our vegetarian friends.  You can't get any more simple than this!

**MEAL 4: Baked Potato**
>Servings: As many potatoes as you bake

>1 Potato

>Cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  Cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.


**MEAL 5: Vegetable Soup**
>Servings: However much you want to make

>Tomatoes, Potatoes, Green Beans, Zucchini, Carrots, Peas, or Onions

>Vegetable Stock

>Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Salt and Black Pepper

>Add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  Season to taste.  Cook on low until vegetables are tender.

EDIT 2: I live in Georgia and shop at Kroger--prices may vary.  If you live in Canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.

EDIT 3: ""Just learn to cook!""--Yeah, okay guys.  I agree.  I cook more than just in a crockpot.  This post was inspired after I read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because ""he didn't have enough time to cook with work"".  I wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  The point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  

EDIT 4: I agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  This post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.

EDIT 5: Electricity costs: Crockpots seem to consume between 200W and 700W per hour.  That's between 2 and 6 kWhs for 8 hours of cooking.  That's about 15 to 60 cents.  It seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.

EDIT 6: I'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  I'm a mechanical engineer.  Don't believe me?  My first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/

1855,Quick Reminder to Not Give Away Your Salary Requirement in a Job Interview,44450,"I know I've read this here before but had a real-life experience with it yesterday that I thought I'd share. 

Going into the interview I was hoping/expecting that the range for the salary would be similar to where I am now. When the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, I responded by asking, ""What is the range for the position?"" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than I was expecting/am making now. Essentially, if I would have given the range I was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than I am making it now) I still would have sold myself short.

1859,IRS will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments,36841,"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-ruling-allows-401k-student-loan-benefits-2018-08-27

The IRS is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees' student loan repayments in the same way companies match 401k contributions. This will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).

Edit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.

According to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. I think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt ""behind"".

Thoughts? This is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive/perk.

Edit 2: due to the popularity of this post, I wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.

>We don't allow:
 • Moralizing issues
 • Petitions
 • Political discussions
 • Political baiting
 • Soapboxing

This is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. Please keep things on topic.


Edit 3: Since a lot of people are confused, I'll explain how a 401k match works. A 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. The 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. Like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. This is usually done via a matching mechanism: I contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. Matches are almost always capped.

With the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. So say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). You aren't contributing to your 401k currently. If your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.

This doesn't ""hurt"" people without loans. This is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. Participation isn't compulsory.",False,personalfinance

Companies need to get back to rewarding employees for their tenure. Until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. When you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. The more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.

1861,"Last month, I spent $770 eating out. This month, I've spent $42. This is only the first of many financial self control habits I'm trying to get myself into!",34943,"In my credit card's April-May billing cycle, I spent **$770** eating out as *one person.* I decided to track my spending in this area by putting all my meals I've been eating out on a credit card used only for that purpose. I looked at the end of the month and was absolutely dumbfounded at the amount of money I was spending eating out. I thought it might be $300ish dollars! 

Anyway, I paid off the credit card (angrily) and made a vow I would eat at home at every possible meal I could for the foreseeable future. I've spent about $70 a week on groceries, (was about $50/week prior) so plus $42, I went from and $1000/mo food expense (how the ever living hell was I making ends meet with this?) to $322/mo. And the kicker is I still have tons of food leftover at the end of the week. The only two meals I bought this month were a BK chicken sandwich while I was on the road and a birthday meal for someone. 

It feels awesome to have a 70% reduction in spending in this area just due to self control.

If you we're going to get the item anyway, yes you saved money, but if you didn't plan on it, you still spent money you didn't have to.

1864,TransUnion burying their credit freeze to sell their own credit monitoring product TrueIdentity,30763,"I'm not sure where to post this, but noticed something had changed on the TransUnion website about freezing credit this morning when I was giving links to family so they could freeze theirs. 

I froze my credit the day after news about the Equifax breach broke, and it looks like TransUnion has since changed their site to push people away from freezing their credit in favor for their own product called TrueIdentity (like what Equifax was doing with their TrustedID Premier.)


The FTC website links to [this page](http://www.transunion.com/freeze) for freezing your credit with TransUnion.


[This is what the website looked before the changes were made on 9/11.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170729070041/https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) The instructions on placing a credit freeze were clear and there was no mention of their own TrueIdentity product.


If you want to place a credit freeze with TransUnion now:

* You have to get through a page of info about credit and fraud, and then the action it tells you to take is to ""Lock your credit information by enrolling in TrueIdentity.""
* The option to freeze your credit is under ""About credit freeze"", deliberately passive in their use of language
* The description about credit freezing is dissuasive: ""A credit freeze may be available under your state law""
* The link for the credit freeze is also a passive ""click here"" compared with ""by enrolling in TrueIdentity"" language used for the link to their own product.
* Clicking the link to learn more about credit freeze brings you to [yet another page](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze2) that tries to convince you to enroll in their product over placing a credit freeze
* After searching through their page of BS, you finally get to the [link to freeze your credit](https://freeze.transunion.com).


This is such a blatant attempt by TransUnion to take advantage of the Equifax breach for their own financial gain. It's a shitty thing for TransUnion to do, and people should be aware that they are being led away from putting an actual credit freeze on their account.

""Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.""

You're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks
NOTE: Make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the Equipment by next tomorrow and get started.

you only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm

**Edit 3** Scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. They threatened us by saying ""you better cash in that check or their agents will find you"".

**Edit 7** We've contacted the school once to report the scam! My girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes A: Reporting it to the FBI and B: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there.

**Edit 9** Reported it to the school, this was their message: 

Hi Girlfriend,

Thank you for sending over this information.  We have flagged this employer in Handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  I know that REDACTED, our Office Manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and I will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  I will also discuss with our Directors about any further steps that need to be taken.

Thank you so much for reporting this!  Please let me know if you have any other concerns.

**Edit 10** Using edits to answer FAQ's now. She did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. Work history, name, etc. She did NOT give bank account details or her SS number.

**Edit 11** Just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, [here you go](http://imgur.com/a/lfw0M)

**Edit 12** I just wanted to confirm this, both Patelco and HCI are legitimet companies. We called Patelco and they have their fraud working on it. We didn't call HCI but I've had enough messages saying they've worked from HCI I believe its legit. I think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.

**Edit 13** Ladies and Gentlemen, I need to give a shout out to /u/dotonfire /u/Kell_Naranek and /u/meanreds . They pointed out that the signature is Thomas Jeffersons. The dead are rising, and they're scamming /s

1869,"Please, for the sake of your wallet, meal prep.",28017,"I'm slowly but surely crawling my way out of that lovely college student debt I incurred over four years and gaining financial independence. I've found out how insanely important meal prepping can be. 

Every Sunday, for about 2 hours, I cook and cook and cook. I make sure I make enough for my fiancé and I to have lunches for the entire week. That's all it takes, two hours!  And like $40 in groceries. When I was really struggling for money, I would still find myself going out to lunch every single day and spending $10-$15 a meal. That's $50-$75 a week!  Now I cook for two people for less than that. 

Just a little advice and personal success here - meal prep your heart out and your wallet will thank you. 

Edit: wow!  Did not know how popular this would get. I can't keep up with replying to posts so I'll address two common comments here. 

1 - a lot of people keep bringing up the point that the ""cost"" of my time is not worth the meal prep and I beg to differ. These two hours I use are two hours that I would just be playing Overwatch or something like that. And the money I'm saving can work for me in paying off debts and investing, so personally it's my best option.  I realize this doesn't work for everyone. I also can't take the easy way out with $5 boxes at Taco Bell or something similar as my body doesn't tolerate gluten which cuts out most fast food options. 

2 - every week I go to Aldi and stock up on brown rice, black beans, corn, ground turkey or tofu, a bag of chicken and some veggies. Most common meal prepped is burrito bowls. Which is 1 pound of ground turkey, 2 cans of beans, 1 can corn, 1 jar of salsa, and brown rice mixed with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and coriander. Makes 12 cups of food at 1,220 calories total. I divide this up into six 2 cup containers. Then usually make chicken with veggies or gluten free pasta for the remaining two days of meals for us. Utilizing four burners, a stove, and a microwave all at once produces a surprising amount of food very quickly. I store it all in Tupperware for the week and it stays well. Some people recommend prepping and freezing as well. Are there some days where I dread eating the same meal and eat out?  Heck yes, but it's not every day like it used to be. And my wallet and waistline has rewarded me greatly for that. ",False,personalfinance
1870,"If you start suddenly getting email/spam ""bombed"" there's probably a reason",27668,"I'm not 100% sure how well this fits here (it is financial), but I wanted to warn as many people as possible.

Last week on Tuesday morning I was sitting at my desk and suddenly started getting emails. Lots, and lots, and lots of them. 30-40 every minute. They were clearly spam. Many of them had russian or chinese words, but random.

I called one of our IT guys and he confirmed it was just me. And the traffic was putting a strain on our mail server so they disabled my account. By that point I have over 700 emails in my inbox. They were bypassing the spam filter (more on that later). After a different situation that happened  a few months ago, I've learned that things like this aren't random.

So I googled ""suddenly getting lots of spam"". Turns out, scammers do this to bury legitimate emails from you, most often to hide purchases. I started going through the 700+ emails one by one until I found an email from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) confirming my purchase of 5 PC graphics cards (over $1000).

I logged into my Amazon account, but didn't see an order. Then I checked - sure enough those cheeky bastards had archived the order too. I immediately changed my password and called Amazon..

I still haven't heard from their security team HOW the breach happened (If they got into my amazon account by password, or did a ""one time login"" through my email.) The spam made it through our spam filter because the way this spam bomb was conducted, they use bots to go out to ""legitimate"" websites and sign your email up for subscription etc. So then I'd get an email from a random russian travel site, and our filters let it through.

Either way - we got the order cancelled before it shipped, and my email is back to normal - albeit different passwords.

And I honestly thought about shipping a box of dog crap to that address (probably a vacant house) but I decided against mailing bio-hazardous waste.

Either way - if you see something suspicious - investigate!

1871,To all the graduating high school seniors and those turning 18 - Get a bank account that's only in your name.,27653,"For minors, it's generally required for a parent to co-sign their bank accounts.  Once you turn 18, it's best to establish an account in your name ONLY, so you have sole control of it.  It would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.

There are a couple reasons for this.  It doesn't take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control.  The parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe.  There could be disagreements between parents and their kids, so they take the money away as a punishment.  Or, it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money.  It doesn't matter who earned the money that's in the account.  If two people are on it, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.

Keep in mind also, having your own account does not mean that your parents can't send you money if you need it.  All they need is your account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account.  In addition, there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if you're still being supported by them.  Other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",False,personalfinance

It's impossible for most people starting out to get to that level of settled in without burying themselves in debt.  So relax, take your time, and embrace the emptiness!  You'll enjoy the house much more if you're not worried about how to pay for everything all the time.

1873,"Heads up: The federal government just filed suit against Navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. This is huge.",27032,"The suit was filed January 18th 2017, by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) against Navient. 

First, know that the CFPB has requested that the Court order Navient to comply with the following actions, among others: 

1. Restitution to consumers harmed by Navient's conduct; 

2. Disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue


Here are the details of the allegations: 

From [consumer affairs .com](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): 
>Specifically, the suit charges that Navient:
>> Fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;

>> Steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;

>> Obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;

>> Deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and

>> Harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.

From the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): 
>In its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and Navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for Navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.

>Specifically, the government alleged that Navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.

>However, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.

>Although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for Navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.

>In all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from January 2010 to March 2015, according to the consumer agency. 

If you want to learn more about this, I highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the CFPB. It is VERY readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. 

You can find the original complaint on the [consumer finance .gov website](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_Navient-Pioneer-Credit-Recovery-complaint.pdf). They also [summarized the complaint on their website](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). 

In the spirit of this sub, I'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. Including myself, as I've been paying down my Navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. 

I'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that I haven't mentioned, I'll update this post. 

**Edit:**
Additional allegations: 

(since July 2011) Disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.

(Jan 2010-March 2015) Using uncharacteristically vague email titles like “New Document Ready to View” to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. During this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. 

**Edit:** There is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. We will have to wait and see. Lawsuits of this magnitude often take a LONG time to get resolved.

1874,My lyft/uber expenses were nearly $750 every month so I instead bought a bike for $900 and now my travel expenses are <$140,26685,"I used to Lyft Line or Uber Pool to work everyday or every other day so this was nearly ~$10 everyday so $200-250/month just for that. In addition I use uber/lyft to get around the city for meeting up with friends, getting groceries, going to meetups etc and that added up a lot. I was so shocked by this because even though the charges are tiny up front they really add up. 

So a few months ago I invested in a nice road bike for $900 and its been solid so far and my Lyft usage dramatically went down. If I am going somewhere <2.5 miles I bike. I live in SF so hills can get pretty crazy so I also avoid areas that are further in the city. Its even cheaper than public transport - which would cost me close to $100 every month to get to work. Instead monthly bike maintenance is <$10 and I can use public transportation to go further into the city. I only use lyft/uber now if I am drunk or need to get to places that neither public transport or my bike can.

Something I thought this sub might enjoy

**Edit:** A lot of questions around why I used Lyft/Uber and Taxi so much when SF is such a walkable city and it has great public transportation. 

No real reason besides I was stupid and incredibly lazy with terrible habits. I moved to SF fresh out of college a year ago and I work in Tech so the salaries are pretty good. I wasn't disciplined about my finances for a while - as a matter of fact I wasn't until the last few months and then expenses racked up and I started building a credit balance. I used to use public transportation a lot and then I moved to a place where it was a little far so I got lazy and started taking Lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in I was taking it everywhere. 

I also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. Bad habits are so easy to foster. But now I am more disciplined in this matter. I was careless. But I am self-aware enough to call myself out - only in this case I could've done it early; but that's alright because I did and made a lot of progress. 

So if you are 22 and are like me and have bad habits that alright. Call yourself out. Block a few hours on a weekend, and do nothing but understand your financial habits and make a budget to the last penny. It might anxiety at first but then you'll get a hold over it and it'll be alright.

**Edit:** Holy shit. This got way more attention than I wanted. A lot of good advice - thank you for that. Thank you to all the people that were being nice. To the ones that reached out to me to be mean - try to be nice. 

I did invest in a good U lock and I also have a cable lock. When I'm at work I take it straight to my desk but when I go grocery shopping I usually lock it with the U-lock and also use the cable lock with the tires. It worked well so far. 

I also cook everyday so that ~$50 a week on groceries and I eat out about ~30 worth every weekend. so about ~$350 in eating a month. A lot of people reached out asking for advice - I will get back to you this weekend. ",False,personalfinance

1903,Do not spend a SINGLE CENT on micro transactions until shaders become unlimited use. #MakeFashionGreatAgain,44039,"I recognize that we are one day into D2's life span, but this is one issue that doesn't need to be further understood. The fact of the matter is, shaders being one time use is a deliberate decision to make an aspect of the game worse, for the sake of profit. I can easily break down why there is no good reason for shaders to be one time use, and why the original system was infinitely better.

1. Frequent consumable drops are not an improvement over rarer permanent rewards.

Getting a stockpile of shaders doesn't beat just having a collection you can use at will, even if the shader drops were so frequent that you never ran out of the ones you want. At that point, why even have them be consumable? Because you're supposed to run out, get impatient, and just start dumping money into eververse so you CAN have a stockpile. 

2. You're going to be collecting armor and weapons in this game, and you're going to need a shader for each and every piece. 

So you did the raid, congratulations! You get one raid shader. Cool! You have dozens and dozens of pieces of gear, and you wanna make most of that gear represent what you achieved. Too bad, you'll have to run the raid possibly hundreds of times to do that. If you decide you like the way a new shader looks on a piece of raid shader gear, kiss that particular raid shader goodbye. 

3. Min-maxers and collectors will basically never use shaders until they have absolutely perfect gear, if they run the risk of losing those shaders every time they find something better.

If you find a piece of equipment you really like, you'll probably wanna throw a snazzy shader on there right? Or do you? Because you might find something better. You never know. Better just hold onto that shader for basically forever because you're constantly in a cycle of finding better gear. It's Destiny. Swapping gear happens every 5 minutes. 

4. Making something that used to be fun, simple recoloring of gear, into a commitment is not a good change.

People like to customize their characters. Some people (myself included) like to do so frequently, and experiment with different looks. If you're burning through shaders, you can't tinker with your appearance at will. 



IN SUMMARY: No one really cares how mad any of us get about the shader situation, but people notice when they aren't making money. I recognize only a small portion of Destiny's player base follows this sub, but the more people we can convince to boycott this micro-transaction BS until something this gets resolved, the better for the long term health of D2.  Micro transactions for cosmetics are usually harmless, but we had a better system in the first game. Plain and simple. This was a choice, and it was not a choice made with the enjoyment of the game in mind. 

Edit: first gold off of a Destiny rant I threw up on my break... thanks stranger!

Edit numero dos: I didn't think this post was gonna get nearly as big as it actually has... and I'm aware of the light media coverage it's getting, so I wanted to take this as an opportunity to say thanks to everyone that shared their opinions with me and the rest of the playerbase. I just wanted to add, I am not against micro-transactions entirely. I don't like them, but I do believe there is a healthy way to implement them into Destiny 2, and the way they're currently being handled isn't it. My main issue here is that shaders did not need this change. They were one of the only things Destiny 1 did really well right out of the gate. I'm a year 1 veteran Destiny player, and I absolutely love Destiny 2 so far. Bungie, you killed it. Thank you. That being said, this a really good chance to make a show of good faith to your community. Just let us keep the shaders we collect. It was a great system to begin with, and I think this community is pretty unanimously unhappy with the new system, aside from the individual shader placement on gear. It feels predatory and it has a lot of people worried about what other ""one step forward, two steps back"" kind of changes may be in the future. We really aren't asking for much here. Bungie plz. I'll let everyone else crucify you for the rest of the micro transaction nonsense that's slowly being pushed, I just want my pretty colors back first.

Also I'm aware that the bullet points are all ones... painfully aware... 


Final Edit now that we've gotten a response: Damn. Well boys and girls it seems the new system is here to stay. I'm not happy about it, but hopefully we are all just as whiny and melodramatic as we're being made out to be, and shaders will end up being in ridiculous surplus (which will basically make them like they were in D1.) At the end of the day, Destiny 2 is a fantastic game outside of this one annoying issue. Grinding out raid shaders is going to suck, and purchased shaders still being a one time use seems pretty damn unfair. That being said, if this much uproar isn't going to change anything, I guess we'll just have to deal with it. So many aspects of the game are great, I can forgive this one. Still not going to spend a single penny on micro-transactions though.",False,DestinyTheGame

Thanks for continuing to be such an awesome community. The day Xûr sold Gjallarhorn(for the second time) and everyone went nuts, it was one of the most fun days I had as a community manager. It was great watching the whole community participating in the chaos, and we always look forward to seeing you all celebrate the anniversary.

Leave a comment in this thread and if we hit 17,777 Uphorns before midnight Pacific, we will choose 7 of you at random to send a [Cayde's Last Stand Statue](https://imgur.com/yN09p4j). The winners will be contacted through private message on reddit and recieve their statues sometime in the next few months.

1907,Our Destiny,30080,"Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47569

---

When we first launched our partnership with Activision in 2010, the gaming industry was in a pretty different place. As an independent studio setting out to build a brand new experience, we wanted a partner willing to take a big leap of faith with us. We had a vision for Destiny that we believed in, but to launch a game of that magnitude, we needed the support of an established publishing partner.


With Activision, we created something special. To date, Destiny has delivered a combination of over 50 million games and expansions to players all around the world. More importantly, we’ve also witnessed a remarkable community – tens of millions of Guardians strong – rise up and embrace Destiny, to play together, to make and share memories, and even to do truly great things that reach far beyond the game we share, to deliver a positive impact on people’s everyday lives.


We have enjoyed a successful eight-year run and would like to thank Activision for their partnership on Destiny. Looking ahead, we’re excited to announce plans for Activision to transfer publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie. With our remarkable Destiny community, we are ready to publish on our own, while Activision will increase their focus on owned IP projects.


The planned transition process is already underway in its early stages, with Bungie and Activision both committed to making sure the handoff is as seamless as possible.


With Forsaken, we’ve learned, and listened, and leaned in to what we believe our players want from a great Destiny experience. Rest assured there is more of that on the way. We’ll continue to deliver on the existing Destiny roadmap, and we’re looking forward to releasing more seasonal experiences in the coming months, as well as surprising our community with some exciting announcements about what lies beyond.


Thank you so much for your continued support. Our success is owed in no small part to the incredible community of players who have graced our worlds with light and life. We know self-publishing won’t be easy; there’s still much for us to learn as we grow as an independent, global studio, but we see unbounded opportunities and potential in Destiny. We know that new adventures await us all on new worlds filled with mystery, adventure, and hope. We hope you’ll join us there.


See you starside.

2014,ULPT: If you have a significant unexplained employment gap that is hurting your resume claim that you were providing full time end of life care for a grandparent (or other older relative).,36396,"I found this out because it actually was true in my case I had a 14 month employment gap after college so I could care for my grandfather who was dying from brain cancer. that gap has always hurt me when I explained it at an interview recently the interviewers entire opinion of me changed in her eyes that gap initially meant I was lazy and coasted for a year after college and once I told her I was caring for my grandfather she realized that her perception of the situation was wrong. After that I wrote it in my resume like it was a job and bam significant increase in the number of interview call backs. 

It's a perfect lie, no one can verify it, they can't ask you details about it without being a dick, you can be as vague as you want and no one will press you, and it makes you look like a goddamn selfless hero.

Edit: My biggest post on reddit is encouraging people to lie about dying relatives, I worry about what this says about me.

Edit2: So this blew up and I've seen a lot of comments questioning the importance of wage gaps so I'm going to use this little spot light I have to give some unsolicited advice from a managers standpoint. 

I work in management and I do a lot of hiring so I want to say in no uncertain terms that unexplained employment gaps do raise red flags, I get enough resumes on my desk that I have to narrow down real quick and employment gaps are an easy category to thin out my stack. 

That being said there are a lot of good reasons for employment gaps if you have one don't be afraid to put it in your resume if you learned something or gained some valuable experience or insight. You might have something that I can't get from Greg who worked accounting for 20 strait years. If you traveled for a year after college summarize what skills you acquired; you can adapt to new environments easily, you work well with a diverse team, etc. If you provided end of life care you learned a lot of responsibility you deal with stress and difficult conditions well. If you spent your 2 years unemployed sniffing glue in your moms basement I can't help you besides telling you to lie but as a manager I just want to know that you did something valuable with your time.

In fewer words don't leave your employment gap up to my imagination I'm cynical enough to fill it in with glue sniffing or prison. 

Also just to answer this line of inquiry that I have seen definitely leave rehab out I have 3 other people just as qualified as you sitting on my desk that didn't just tell me that they (used to) have an impulse control problem. I love second chances and all that but my job performance is partially determined by the quality of the team I hire, risks no matter how noble aren't in my best interest.",False,UnethicalLifeProTips

#[I’m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I’m running for US Senate in West Virginia.](http://imgur.com/U9Jtsbx)

---

Barely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.

---

###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. 

---

“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.

Not only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.

A month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.

Like most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed
first-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.

The promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.

It’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to
inherit the struggles that we have had to endure. 

I’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I’ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the [Brand New Congress platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801), including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.

We're here to answer your questions about it, or net neutrality in general, so ask us anything!",72338,"Hey Reddit,

This summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.

This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can’t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.

To push back, we’ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you’re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** 

In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon’s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.

We are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.

No matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.

UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue?

2149,I'm an ex-Scientologist who was trafficked for labor by Scientology from ages 15 - 18. I reported it to the FBI and they did nothing. AMA [Trigger Warning],68408,"My name is [Derek Bloch](https://www.youtube.com/user/dbloch7986). 

I am not the typical ""high-ranking"" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). [Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.](https://truepic.com/gx54exce) 

FTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.

[First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists.](http://www.forum.exscn.net/threads/a-brief-summary-of-my-time-inside.26189/#post656666) It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.

After Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a >!""pussy""!< for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a >!""faggot""!<. >!{Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}!<

[Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.](https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/05/16/scientology-disconnection-and-homophobia-derek-blochs-story/)

>!(Ef yoo dad.)!<

[I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1328-5-disturbing-things-i-learned-in-scientologys-space-navy.html)

I tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. [Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)](https://tonyortega.org/2017/07/27/derek-bloch-on-fighting-scientology-disconnection-in-an-unaired-tv-series-2/)

Obviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.

*On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!*

2175,(Some) girls really do tell their friends about their sex lives.,16604,"I (32 M) have been dating this amazing girl (31F) for 5 months. It’s embarrassing to admit but I have a micro penis, it’s just shy of 3” when hard. 

My self esteem and confidence related to my penis have really impacted my dating life, my current gf is only the 2nd sexual partner I have had.

After dating a couple weeks I told her I wanted to take it slow, she agreed. Last week I told her I had a small penis and that’s why I wanted to take it slow, she told me she didn’t care about the size of my penis, but we’ll go at what ever pace I’m comfortable at. 

On the weekend we had Sex for the first time, I went down on her until she came, then she gave me a bit of a blow job and told me she wanted to ride me. So I laid down and she did, she alternated between riding me and just grinding on me, she really seemed to enjoy the grinding. I really liked it too and came.

The next morning I was in the shower, when I came out she was on the phone with her Bff, I have met her. And they were talking about sex. My heart sank, I was just waiting for her to tell her friend all about how small I am. 

That didn’t happen. She told her that we had *finally* had sex, she used the word ‘amazing’ to describe it. She told her I was amazing at oral and said “and you know how I feel about oral” (she also told me how she feels about oral and that it’s really important to her) she also told her friend it was the first time she had had an orgasm during a ‘first time’  not once did she mention my small size, she didn’t give away any real intimate details, she just told her how much she enjoyed it. 

I was always scared that any girl I dated would share with her friends my lack of endowment, but I guess I didn’t have to. 

Some girls do talk, but that’s okay.

Edit: wow reddit gold, of course on a post where I talk about my penis 😆 thanks anonymous redditor.

2176,"Sexual Pet Peeve: Men, do NOT apologize for orgasming ""too soon"" during sex. You were enjoying yourself! and you still have fingers!",12815,"Every time I feel a guy orgasming, I feel so powerful. Then for some reason, no matter how long they actually lasted, out comes some kind of apology for how they ""usually arent like this"" or ""sorry"". An apology and guilt is literally the last thing I want to hear from a guy who just came from my actions! When im still hella riled up and fuzzy!

Its an instant turn off and kills my enjoyment of the afterglow or still ongoing sexual moment.

I know that for some reason society focuses the entire act of sex on just penis insertion into vaginas and shames men for not witholding their orgasm. This is wrong and bad. 

The correct response is to immediately reach down and start rubbing the clit of who you are with if you really feel you came sooner than youd like and she didnt get off. If you came, im sure she would LOVE to hear how her pussy got you off so quick and how good she is as you do this. Not one woman is going to complain about this. 

If you arent up to it in your instant post orgasmic bliss, give it 20 minutes and go again!

The stereotype of women being annoyed at men who last 1 minute comes from the fact that usually men just roll over and go to sleep and stop touching her when he orgasms, ending the whole affair and leaving her hanging.

In general, please dont enter the self-guilt trip for reaching orgasm between the thighs of your parter. Or down their throat. That IS the objective of sex, after all. Healthier attitudes will improve your sex more than berating yourself every time you cum in less than 20 minutes or some crazy number.

edit: 
To the other women here saying you are disappointed when he finishes too quick, please tell me what you want to happen. Yall are missing the point.

Men are going to cum fast sometimes, fact of biology. One response is for them to immediately feel guilty, say some ashamed apology to you, and roll over.

The other option is to make it sexy and try again later. Not sure why you would prefer option A in any scenario unless you enjoy humiliation.

This post says ""you dont need to apologize or express shame immediately after cumming because of your own body"" not ""no woman needs PIV and men should all be minutemen"".

And people who specifically make mean comments at you are people you dont want to waste time with anyway. Goes for both sexes.",False,sex
2177,I was groomed into prositution by my boyfriend when I was 15 and didn’t realise it.,12788,"I was 15 years old and he was 10 years older than me. He was handsome, charming, sweet and caring towards me. He approached me at the mall one day and told me I was gorgeous and I was so flattered, I was popular with boys my own age but I always thought I was too mature for them. The fact that a handsome older guy approached me made me delighted, I was instantly smitten with him! 

He talked to me for a little bit and he asked my age, when I told him I was 15 he acted all surprised he thought I was older. I believed him because I always got told I looked older than my age as I’m latina so curves haha. He told me he was so sorry and pretended like he felt guilty because I was so young, I told him it was fine and he said he felt a connection with me and he wanted to be friends. We started texting non-stop, he’d flirt with me and then apologise and say he just couldn’t help himself because of how attracted he was to me. I was falling for him the more I talked to him and I was convinced he was a good guy. 

We would hang out at the mall alot and he would always buy me things, I felt guilty taking it at first but he told me I deserved nice things and that he wanted me to have things that reminded me of him. I was falling for him and after a month of us being ‘friends’ it was me who made a move on him, I thought he was so sweet and the fact he didn’t try to come onto me made me not doubt his intentions at all. I kissed him one night and he told me that he wanted me but that he didn’t want to take advantage of my age. I begged him to try with me, that age is just a number and that the connection we have is special. His manipulation was working on me already and we started dating.

My mom and dad guessed that I was seeing somebody but I didn’t tell them anything about him, I knew they wouldn’t understand and they would freak out about the age difference. (obviously). He started telling me things like if they really wanted me to be happy they wouldn’t care and how I am too mature to be treated like a child by my parents. I started to believe him and my relationship with my parents who I was always close with became very strained, we started arguing all of the time and I just wanted to be with him every minute of everyday. I became obsessed with him. 

He asked me to be his girlfriend a month later and we started to be sexual. I lost my virginity to him and I thought it was perfect, he was so caring and loving and I knew I was in love with him after that. I would have done anything for him, he was perfect in my eyes. We started sleeping together regularly and there was nothing out of the ordinary, he told me he loved me and I couldn’t be happier. My relationship became more and more strained with my parents and after I turned 16 I left home and went to live with him, I dropped out of high school because he told me he would take care of me. 
He made me tell my parents I was staying with a friend because they ‘wouldn’t understand’ so I did. I cut all contact with my family and my life revolved around him, looking back and typing this out I can’t believe I was so stupid but he manipulated me so badly I would have done anything for him, and I did. 

Everything was perfect until about 2 months into me living with him. He introduced me to one of his friends, he was older than him and I didn’t like him. I thought he was creepy and he stared at me like I was a peice of meat. My boyfriend told me that he really likes me and hes so jealous that my boyfriend gets to be with me. He then told me that he asked him could he sleep with me and I thought he would be like no way, but he told me it would make him happy if I did. I was confused and freaked out at him and he told me that maybe I’m just too immature for an adult relationship and he made a mistake. I got upset and told him I’d do anything and he said ‘thats my girl’ and arranged for me to sleep with him. It was horrendous, I hated every second of it but I was so blinded by love and I thought that this was what I had to do, I didn’t realise that he was prostituting me out to this man it never even crossed my mind.

After that, more and more ‘friends’ would be introduced to me and would want to sleep with me. He told me that it was because I’m so stunning and sexy that all men wanted to sleep with me and that he wanted me to enjoy myself with his friends. I became miserable, I hated what I was doing but I did it for him and I wanted to do it even if I hated it because that’s what you do when you love someone. That’s what he told me. I still niavely had no jdea he was prostituting me out to his friends. One night he told me one of his friends where coming over and I told him I didn’t want to do it tonight and I hated doing stuff with them. He gave me coke, told me it would make it feel better and would make me enjoy it more. 

I started taking coke almost everyday, to numb the horrible feelings I felt inside of me day in and day out. He started making me do gang bangs and threesomes and if I refused he would hit me. He would tell me that it was all my fault and he wouldn’t have to do it if I just listened to him. 

This went on for a year and a half, until one day the cops raided his apartment and they took me for questioning. They told me I had been groomed and I didn’t believe them, I told them that he loved me and that they where wrong. The police told me he was in charge of a prostitution ring and when they asked me did he ever make me have sex with other men I broke down. Only then did I realise what I had been doing. The police called my parents and they where distraught, they where looking for me everywhere and they didn’t know if I was even still alive. He got tried and him and all of his friends are in jail for a long time.

No matter how long he’s in jail for it doesn’t take away that he took my childhood from me, my innocence and everything. I’ve had therapy since it happened and I’m feeling alot better, I finally have a boyfriend and I’m in a happy relationship. I have a job and I am going to college soon. This was 4 years ago and I will make sure that I have a good future and my life isn’t over.

I wanted to write this because I wanted to share my story anonymously and I want people to know how easy it is to be groomed. I hope that if any young girls read this they will see how easy it is to be groomed and please not make the mistake I did. I still have my bad days and days where I feel guilt and shame wash over me, but over the years they have been less frequent. If you read all of this thanks for reading my story. 

EDIT: Wow. Thankyou everyone for all of your lovely replies. I didn’t expect this post to blow up so much and such a positive response. I’m moved to tears by all of the kind comments and people telling me I’m strong is such an amazing feeling. I’ve felt weak for so long it means alot to me. ",False,sex

2179,"Isn’t it incredible when a polite, friendly guy is surprisingly dominant in bed?",12129,"So I slept with one of my best friends this weekend for the 2nd time. The first time we did was a month ago after we’d been out drinking, and it was very... tender? And like we were learning each other’s bodies. He is an awesome person, one of the most kind and caring friends I have. He has such a genuine personality and the most warm smile... it felt really good being with him that night, and it hasn’t messed up our friendship at all. 

We live in different cities, and haven’t had a chance to hang out since then. When we saw each  other this weekend, I was really hoping it would happen again but I wasn’t sure if he was feeling it.

We went out with a group of friends, and when we were at the bar he started by gently brushing my arm and whispering in my ear - talking about what he would do to me when we get home, how he was going to make me dripping wet, how my body was driving him wild... it was so hot hearing him breathe these sentences in my ear and still having to act normal in front of everyone. 

It escalated for a few hours, and by the time we started kissing I felt like I was going to explode! His hands were so warm, he knew exactly where to touch me. Just as we were about to start having sex, he grabbed my face and said “I’m going to be a bit rough, is that okay?” FUCK. I melted. 

This second time was so different from the first. He completely took control and held me down on the bed, sometimes he’d choke me or cover my mouth. It was so fucking hot seeing this cute, polite boy transform into a dominant, powerful machine haha. Fuck I keep thinking about it.

2183,What I've learnt in the last year about sex with having no penis.,8743,"Hi all. 

Basically, I had my penis removed last year because of cancer. For content, you can read my post history. 

I feel like I need to ""pay it forward"" to you all because a post I made on here gave me some amazing sound advice and has transformed my sex life, and I'd like to help those out going through the same. 

First and foremost, just because you are not using a penis doesn't mean you can't have sex. 

I mean, most would go ""no shit Sherlock"" but this was the biggest thing I feared before my surgery that I would never have sex again. In the last year, I've discovered this isn't the case - yes, I can't have natural penetrative sex (I'm not counting using a strap on) but now I define sex as so much more. We have oral sex, use our fingers, stimulate our nipples, even have kissing sessions and I count it as racy sex sessions. And when we do use a strap on for sex, it's as a ""treat"". 

And on that point, I can say quality is better than quantity. 

Before the op, we had sex about 7 times a week - and it always ended in me cumming. Now, I'd say we make it about half as many times, but the quality is amazing. As opposed to 15-20 minute sessions, we go on for over a good hour now sometimes and we often can't look at each other afterwards. 

And as I don't have any penis, I don't always cum but that's alright as she has so many good orgasms now - in fact, we have shifted and she has more orgasms now than I do which I really enjoy as it gives me a massive ego boost. If before I didn't cum, it would be the end of the world but now we know that isn't the be all and end all. 

Also, it's taught me that body confidence is a thing in itself. After I had the op, I had months where I couldn't face being naked around her as I felt ""less than"" or ashamed. Since I've been working on myself, I've learnt that being comfortable in your own skin goes a long way to feeling sexy - if you feel sexy, someone else will find you sexy too. 

Lastly, I've learnt that communication is important especially about boundaries. 

A few months back, my partner bought up the idea of pegging on myself and initially I was horrified. My last posts did nothing to help me as so many tried to talk me into it and I was so resistant. 

We had a conversion about it again not so long ago and I dismissed it, saying flat out no. She asked me why and I said basically it would feel so emasculating to be bent over and ""fucked"" by her - it signifies all what has changed and has been lost by losing my willy. She said I don't have to be ""fucked"" by her at all, she just wanted to make me feel better about myself. We talked long and hard, and decided that if we try anal on me, she doesn't have to wear a strap on at all and we can use a non phallic toy to stimulate me without being""fucked"" at all. 

We went over my last posts and found some good recommendations for genuine prostate massagers that we may try. But by communicating, we worked it out together. 

It's early days yet, but I'm getting there and sexually in a far better place than I was 6 months ago. And because you all helped me out so much, I feel that this post is my chance to help others out the same way I was helped. 

Thank you all so much!

EDIT: Wow, gold and silver! Thank you so much kind strangers.

Further edit: People ask me how I orgasm, or typically what it takes to get me there. 

The vast majority of my orgasms come from having my balls, perineum and inner thighs stimulated typically by my partner's tongue. The feeling is a million times more intense now than it used to be, and being pleasured down there leads to ejaculation as well as an orgasm. 

Also, I have had them from my nipples being played with. They have become an erogenous zone since my operation, and the orgasms are out of the world from them. 

And also, for those asking, I still very much come. It comes from a hole created just behind my balls in the perineum area. I still have my prostate and testicles so the consistency, appearance etc is still normal- it just dribbles out.",False,sex
2184,Warning about Hitachi vibrators,8712,"Don't get me wrong, I love my Hitachi. But I have a warning! 

I use mine daily. I hold it in my left hand. After three months of daily use, I started losing sensation in my fingertips. I thought no big deal. Took a break for a week. Still no feeling. Shrugged and went back it it. Now, a year later, my ring-middle-pointer fingers have no sensation. I finally fessed up to my doctor, who did neuro testing and found out that my nerves are numb and it is permanent. They said it can happen from too much vibration. I can still feel my junk, so at least there's that! 

Just. Be careful with heavily vibrating things.

2185,PSA: If a girl says use a condom USE THE DAMN CONDOM,8697,"As a female I cannot express the frustration of hooking up with a guy and the guy just tries to slip the dick in without protection. And when you try and say “no, not without a condom” you are faced with opposition and an argument. If I say no, use a condom, that should be it. Use a condom. 

TWICE I have had this encounter with guys where they didn’t want to use a condom but took it even further. Despite the conversation and my hard stance on having safe sex (especially since they were both Tinder guys) they BOTH (separate encounters) proceeded to do it anyways. I pulled them out of me and tried to hold my ground about no unprotected sex. They continue to beg and try and persuade me. One even waited a few seconds and then put it back in anyways! After I took it out! 

I don’t care if you don’t like using condoms or if it doesn’t feel as good or you can’t finish as easily. If you are sleeping with a stranger and they ask you to use a condom just do it or go home. Don’t argue. Don’t beg. Don’t ask for “just a minute” and then you’ll put one on. And for the love of god don’t just do it anyway! ",False,sex
2186,My wife and I made up a 24/7 [sex game] that keeps things spontaneous. We thought you all might get a kick out of it!,8672,"**Background:**  
My wife and I are in our mid-20s. We've been together five years and married for about three of them, living together before we even started dating. We share this account, but I (Mr. Easyweeks) will be the author of this post. We will respond to comments/PMs together.  
  
We have a very active and healthy sex life together. Like every relationship, there are surges when we have sex more times in a week than there are days. There are also lulls when we might go a week or more without expressing our lust for each other. In general, we have sex 3-4 times per week, but engage in other foreplay almost daily. We're fairly adventurous and have excellent communication both in and outside of the bedroom. I can't remember how we came up with this game (probably eating breakfast naked on a Saturday morning), but it's been around for about a year and a half now.  
  
---------------------------------------  
  
**The Game:**  
The game is built around these small notes we leave throughout our lives. Each of us writes our own notes on color-coded paper, and leaves them wherever we want to. If the other finds a note that's on your colored paper, they have to do whatever your note says. The notes are small and folded in a way that they can't be read from the outside, and they're sealed with double-sided tape. There's no way to read the content without damaging the note. The notes sometimes have things that have to be done immediately, and sometimes things that have a time or condition.  
  
There are only a few rules:  
1) If you find a note, you must open it on the spot.  
2) We each started with 10 notes hidden throughout our lives. Once I find a note of hers, I'm allowed to put another one out into the world. At that point, she has 9 hidden and I have 11. This way, the notes self-balance. The more she finds of mine, the less of mine there are and the more of hers.  
3) Be fair. Exceptions are always made to accommodate current circumstances, but we try hard to honor the intent of the notes we find. 
  
**Examples:**  
Before we started for the first time, each of us wrote about 15 or 20 notes. That way we would have some extra to put out as soon as we found some of the other's.  

Some of the ones she wrote:  
*""Sneak away somewhere and take 5 naughty pictures. Send them to my phone.""*  
*""The next time we're at a movie, play with me in the dark.""*  
*""Come find me and go down on me on the spot, without warning.""*  
*""Transform our bedroom without me knowing. Candles, music, lighting, scents, all of it. Make love to me all night.""*  
  
Some of the ones I wrote:  
*""Starting right now, you're not allowed to wear underwear for a week.""*  
*""Come find me and see how fast you can make me cum, anything is allowed.""*  
*""Write a nasty fantasy and send it to me.""*  
*""The next time we leave the house, we each have to cum before we can go home.""*  
*""Play with yourself until you're dripping wet. Take your clothes off, come hunt me down, put me on the nearest flat surface, and ride my face.""*  
  
**How it plays out:**  
The great thing is that, even though we wrote our own notes, we never know when the other will find them. We can hide them in places that are obvious and short-term like in a wallet or under the toothpaste. We can also hide them in places that we know are going to take a while to find, like in the wrong month of a wall calendar or in the battery compartment of a remote control. A lot of times we've forgotten we even asked for what's happening until we're pleasantly (very) surprised!  
  
It kinda goes like this (true story). I'm in the garage working on a project. It's been a couple weeks since I've really been out here working, but it's nice to be in the thick of a wood project again. I'm digging through my toolbox for something and I catch a flash of bright blue tucked in the back. I grin because I *know* that color (her color)... I pull it out of the drawer, tear it open, and read what it says. It's a simple one: ""Come find me and have sex with me somewhere in the house we never have before"". At first I thought to myself that there aren't any undefiled places in our house, but then really think about it. *Every* closet? *Every* hallway? *Every* bedroom? The garage itself? Anyways, I went inside and found her entirely oblivious. She knew I found a note as soon as I took her hand and led her upstairs, but she still didn't know *which* note I found. We fucked on the floor of a spare room that we use for crafts and made a really fun goofy time of it!  
  
Anyways, It never really gets old! Over time the notes have gotten more creative, but we've also reused plenty of them! A couple times people have found one at our house, but they just ask ""what's this?"" and we say ""ah must be trash from something"". I feel like no one would just go opening a piece of scrap paper that was clearly taped shut... I think one time a friend of mine found a blue note. It was secretly amusing to me that someone else unsuspectingly delivered my fate to me...

2187,Virgins take warning.,8131,"I (22 F) grew up in the US south in a ultraconservative religious household. Officially, sex outside marriage made Jesus weep. But also my aunt told me, ""realistically,"" that sex is something women do to make men happy. It's not really fun for girls, it's one way to serve your husband, etc. So I never tried because 1) Jesus would weep and 2) it wouldn't be that good anyway so what's the point? 

Went to college, changed my mind, left the church, etc. and decided to have sex with my boyfriend this week.

Oh. My. God. You fucking guys. I HAVE BEEN LIED TO MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE. Sex is supposed to be painful & difficult for ladies? BUT SEX IS GOOD!! Sex is so, so good. 

I love it. I love rough sex. I love getting fucked hard-- it feels better than anything in the world. I love being on top, I love him being on top, I love doggy style, I love missionary, I love being fucked against the bed and the wall and the desk and the chair. 

And I love giving head! It is not dirty or degrading at all. Gagging is minimal. Semen just tastes like slighly tangy mucus. Oral sex is about pleasure, and fun, and respect, and trust. He puts his most sensitive and fragile part into your mouth (full of teeth that could easily bite and hurt him), you show him you're grateful for the trust. And a dick in your mouth is the best way to start the day! 

There's nothing ugly or degrading or shameful about sex. It's like the best parts of dancing and working out and laughing and making inside jokes, all combined. The physical sensations are beyond description, and you get to see the other person at their strongest and most beautiful. You get to share the innermost, most secret, most vulnerable part of yourself with another person-- and be celebrated. You can celebrate someone else's power without being hurt or diminished yourself.

I will never, ever stop having sex, and I will never, ever feel ashamed about it.   

Virgins, take warning: sex is GOOD.

EDIT: Wow, this went up fast! To everyone who said ""You made my day"" (or variants thereof): awww, I'm glad! I was just real excited to share my discovery with something. 

To everyone advising safe sex: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I'm on the pill and we're looking into an implant/IUD. There are no babies in my future.

And these are things they can’t really control, I mean sometimes you cum a little earlier than usual, and sometimes you lose your erection, and some of you may not have an eggplant sized piece but these things don’t make you any less lovable. 

You may have already met someone, and if not, you will meet someone who will fall in love with you, who will click with you and will find it sexy when you cum regardless of when, because they’ll love you and love seeing you in pleasure. If you lose your erection, well, you don’t need to be in your head, your SO will enjoy just kissing and cuddling you just as much, even if your friend doesn’t want to cooperate. 

It’s not just about the sex, it’s also about the intimacy, if I’m undressing myself with you and being in a state I wouldn’t put myself in with anyone else, I’m enjoying all of it, all of you, no matter what. I have no unrealistic expectations and I’m fully aware you’re human and not a sex robot. My body has its moments where it’s not cooperating either, sometimes I’m in my head, sometimes I hide certain body parts that I’m insecure about and that can affect my performance, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt nearly as much pressure as I would if I were a man. 

Men, stop being so hard on yourselves, it’s okay to be human and your body will not cooperate every time. Us women, we love you, and if some of us women are mean about it, then you should walk away and find a more rational person to have sex with. 

EDIT: I’m really happy that I was able to spread a positive message, and that this blew up and reached a broad range of people. Everyone is worthy of love; I hope that you can all see this and treat yourselves a little better instead of feeling ashamed for being human.

2189,The real reason I want to shower with my partner,7954,"I’m just going to be honest, I (28M) don’t ever want to have sex in the shower. When I say “want me to join you?” I mean I want to get in that steamy, close quarters enclosure and have absolute freedom on where and how I touch you. 

Showering with someone to me is one of the most sensual things you can do. I just want to lather you up and caress every inch of your body, and I want you to do the same to me. Press those tits into my back while you feel my chest as I’m washing my hair and I’ll massage your clit while kissing your neck as you rinse the suds off your body. We don’t ever have to actually have sex but let’s fully explore each other’s bodies, teasing each other with the thoughts of how we’re going to fuck once we get out. 

It’s all about the build up and anticipation for me. Just my thoughts on the subject.",False,sex
2190,I said no and it went better than I expected,7919,"I never say no to sex, or to giving head, not because I'm in an abusive relationship or anything, but because im just as horny, if not more, than my bf, so I'm more than happy to get it on.

So earlier today, i was Not Feeling It. I woke up with a pounding headache and my nose clogged up. I was in a bad mood all day and all i wanted was to sleep when i got home. But my bf surprised me by picking me up from work and buying me lunch. We decided to stop by an adult store to buy some lube and see if anything else there tickled our fancy. We ended up buying a new vibe for me.

We got to his place and sure enough he starts to get handsy. We make out for a while but i just can't get into it. So i push away slightly and tell him I'm not really in the mood and would rather take a nap. He smiles and kisses me lightly and tells me not to worry. He tucks me into bed and i fell asleep almost instantly.

Its probably not a big deal to anyone else, but to me it meant so much. He didn't pout, didn't get upset, didnt even ask why (although it was probably pretty obvious with my stuffed up nose). Its those small things that really make me fall in love with him and make me want to choke on his dick.

Edit: i've been reading nearly all the comments and the ones that stand out the most are thise that are saying how ssad it is to praise men for doing the bare minimum, and i understand why this is upsetting. Its behavior that should be expected, like being a big boy and understanding and not being a dick about a simple 'no'.

To me, its a big deal because previous partners have not been so kind. Both male and female. I've had a female partner (fwb) who would leave if i declined sex and go fuck someone else. I've had male fwb who would spam with with texts annoying thr hell out of me.

So let me make this clear, to me this is big, i have someone who is mature and i sure as hell will celebrate it. And, this is not a strictly heterosexual thing and to think so is really narrow minded.

Also thanks for silver!

2191,Sucking dick is completely underrated.,7720,"I am the only one in my entire friendship group that actually enjoys blow jobs. It’s absolutely crazy to me how not only none of my friends like it, they hate it! I think it’s one of the sexiest things ever and probably my favourite part of sex in general. 

There’s nothing hotter than kneeling in front of a guy and unzipping his pants to find he’s hard and then taking him into your mouth. Sometimes I even get excited to see he’s soft too, I really like the feeling of him getting hard in my mouth. I love everything about it. I love the idea of sucking it. love being so close and personal to his cock. I love tasting his pre cum. I love hearing him moan in pleasure. I love seeing his toes curl. I love feeling him explode in my mouth. I just love everything about it. 

I think I’m very good at oral sex, part of that is technique but I think a huge part of that is my attitude towards it. I don’t need to be on my period to suck cock, I don’t need to be bribed or asked to suck cock. I genuinely love it. I actually feel like I should thank him for letting me suck him... is that crazy? It feels like a gift haha. I think the way you approach oral sex and your attitude towards it is probably equally as importantly technique. But, here are some things I like to do that I think make it even better for the guy...

- Eye contact. It makes me feel so dirty and submissive to look up at him while I suck his cock. I think the eye contact makes it so sexy.

- I like to tease at first by kissing his thighs, slowly working my way to his balls. 

- Never ever forget about the balls! This is so important. Lick them slowly, lick them fast, lick them with the tip of your tongue (make it pointed), lick them with your tongue flat and definitely suck them but be very very gentle!

- Lick all the way from the base of his dick to the tip. 

- Slapping his dick across your face usually goes down well.

- Always always always continue to lick his head while you suck. Swirl your tongue around, up and down, side to side, anything. Just keep it moving constantly. Sucking shouldn’t be just up and down, your tongue works wonders!

- Dirty talk! Silence is fine, moans are better but dirty talk is much sexier. Make sure he’s into it though, not every guy might be but I find telling him how wet you are, how much this is turning you on, how much you love his dick or how much you want him inside you, how your his slut, will always go down well.

- Moan moan moan! He’s going to love hearing you moan while you suck him. He will also feel the vibrations of you moaning on his dick too.

- Try and deep throat, if you can, brilliant. If you can’t, take as much as you can for as long as you can then gag and tell him how big he is and how you can’t take it all but how much it turns you on trying. No guy is going to unhappy hearing his dick is too big for your mouth.

- Fake deep throating. Make sure your hand is wet, stroke him and suck the tip in your mouth. This will stop the gagging, mean you can focus all your attention on his head and also give him the feeling of deep throating.

- masturbate if you can, I’ve found that if your able to play with yourself while doing it then that just sends guys over the edge. Not only does it show how into it you are, it also feels so dirty and if your wet enough they will be able to hear that while you suck his dick. 

- Ask him where he wants to cum/tell him where you want him to cum. If you have no preference where he finishes then ask him what he likes, just make it sexy! If he says he wants to cum in your mouth, something like ‘mmmm, you want to fill up my mouth with that cum?’ Or ‘empty your balls into my mouth’ would work. If you don’t like it in your mouth then say something like ‘I want you to cum in my face, I want to feel like your dirty slut’ is much better than ‘no I don’t like the taste of cum’

- If he’s taking too long and your mouth is sore then tell him your so horny you can’t wait anymore, you need him inside of you right now. This is much better than ‘are you almost done? My jaw hurts’ 

- Compliment his dick but make sure you mean it. If he’s not the biggest hen he’s going to know that, don’t tell him he’s huge because he will know your lying, tell him how hard his cock is and how good it feels in your mouth. If he is big then definitely make sure to tell him! Make sure you tell him how big and full his balls are, how good his cum tastes, how sexy he looks while you suck his cock, how attractive his cock is, how sexy he sounds moaning for you etc. Guys need compliments too! But they must be genuine.

- Surprise him with blow jobs. A wake up blow Job or shower job will always go down well. Wait until he’s on the phone of playing Xbox and unzip his pants, make it feel naughty.

- I can’t remember the actual word for it, but the thin line on his balls (should be straight down the middle separating both his testicles) is very sensitive. You must be super gentle but licking this very carefully should feel amazing for him.

- Don’t wait to be asked to suck his dick. Start sucking before he even has a chance to ask for a blow job, show him how much you love it by doing it by choice, not because he asked.

- Don’t ask for oral back every single time you suck his dick. It makes it look like a chore and that your only doing it to get something in return. It’s fine to do this sometimes, but if it’s every single time it gives the impression you only do it to get oral back. If he offers himself that’s different of course.

- If your happy to swallow his cum then great. If your not then try and make it sexy. Let him cum in your mouth and then let it drip down on to your breasts (or let him cum on them if you don’t even want it in your mouth) and then rub his load into your boobs like lotion. Make sure to smile and make eye contact while you do it.

EDIT: Wow! That’s for all the responses, I didn’t expect this to blow up (pun intended). I just wanted to add that of course you need to get permission to suck his dick before you actually do it, especially if it’s a surprise. I just figured that went without saying so I didn’t feel the need to mention that. Another thing, I didn’t mean you shouldn’t want oral in return, I just meant don’t ask for it as it looks like your doing it to be pleasured back, I didn’t mean you shouldn’t want your pussy licked. Yes my post is very ‘porn star’ but I mean.... how many guys are going to complain that you suck dick like a porn star? I literally can’t think of any! If the guy your with doesn’t like something I’m sure he will tell you and you can change that. Communication is obviously key! Also, I’m definitely female 😂😂",False,sex
2192,"I found out that when my girlfriend feels loved; her sex drive, her wildness and her dirtiness are limitless. My sex life has changed. My relationship has never been stronger. Thanks reddit !",7447,"A bit of context- I always had an amazing relationship and we’re very passionate and compatible. Her sex drive has always been quite high, but over the months it decreased slightly. Our relationship never had troubles, but I just took some advice here and there from reddit.
I learnt a ‘secret’ (probably not so secret) about women’s libido that really strengthen my relationship.
Whenever I was horny , I used to send dick pictures or other ‘visuals’, I used to tell her I wanted to fuck her hard. If we were together I’d touch her, or kiss her breasts. All of this worked very well in the beginning, because we were still exploring each other.
However over the long term, it didn’t have the same effect on her. She was very opened about it and told me that it’s not the way she would be turned on, though she did enjoy the pictures and kisses. 

Now I realized that women (sorry if this is a generality and I’m certain it does not apply to all women) are more turned on by ROMANCE. I truly love her and so here are all the advice and little things I picked up that really worked for me over the last few months. What’s amazing is that it’s like passion never wore off between us. The sex has never been that incredible and she is the one constantly initiating now. I had a lot of relationship fail because I did not realize this / or realize this way too late- and sex is the first factor that goes wrong in a failing relationship. 
So thank you reddit, for all these advices I picked up from the thousands of posts I read.

1)     Words (making her understand  that she is unique , that she is the one and only) : this can be by texts , verbally , or letters. What worked the best for us is when these words were very sincere - actual qualities she has or actual experiences I had With her that made me feel amazing with her. This needs to be done regularly and not just before sex. 
2)     Give her some space regularly and send thoughts constantly
3)     When you are apart : instead of starting with a visual picture : start with how much you want to be with her and actually make love to her, be close to her. Then be as naughty as you want together. 
4)     Make- out sessions- instead of directly touching her- I kissed her intensely and with love and let her come to me. It’s important to take the time for that. 
5)     Emotional connections- these moments and build-ups made her (and myself) crazy aroused. Not easy to have after a few months/ years so here is the best advice I picked: choose a time / place (restaurant, at home, bar...) with no tv, no distractions. Drink a bit together to be tipsy and closer. And listen to each other. Ask questions that build connection/ deep questions. Here are some:
- What’s a time where you were happy ?
- What is your real and deepest insecurity ?
- How have you changed over the year?
- What do you think of marriage?
- What do you think is the secret of a good relationship?
- Tell me about a couple you know that you admire?
- What do you think is the biggest mistake in a relationship?
- What advice would you give to a friend for his proposal?
- Tell me the details of your hardest experience ?
- Tell me the details of X experience?
- What do you think of this trait of character?

2193,PSA: Don't have sex in changing rooms. (public sex),7430,"I see it come up a lot when people talk about finding places to have sex in public., but I've worked changing rooms and here is why it's a dick move.

I know what you're doing. It's about as subtle as a teenage boy at a swimming pool, and everyone thinks they are getting away with it when in reality it can be for multiple reasons (not paid enough, social anxiety, actually don't care). This is a very sex positive sub Reddit, so it can be hard to remember that sex can make some people very uncomfortable and causing that discomfort to a stranger in public/at their place of work is really really rude.

It's not just me, there are kids and families and just other people too. All of the above applies to them, and the more people the more likely one of them is going to have a bad time with it. Also could be taking a room someone could need for it's intended purpose. But you go when it's slower it puts more pressure on the attendant.

What I don't know is the specifics. I don't know if you are full on having sex and wiping it on the clothes I'll later have to pick up. I don't know if she is going to swallow and leave no mess. I don't know what you did on that bench, and now I either have to get all up in that room to clean it, or let the little girl that comes after you sit on it to put on her pants. Sure, you might not be the rudest or messiest about it, but it's not like I know that.

You are making your kinks my problem without my consent or any of the others around you. Also, those rooms are filthy af.

And no, not getting caught isn't all that matters. It's about not putting others in a position they don't want to be in and that makes them uncomfortable. Definition of a dick move. Sure, say the odds of you getting caught are slim (not that every time people are caught they know about it.) you are determining for others that your pleasure is more important than the risks for making their day worse. Again, literally the definition of a dick move.

Edit: Libraries, cinemas, and airplanes. These things apply to more than just retail workers, and in general just try to live life without being too much of a dick (or cunt).

Edit 2: You can often tell a couple that is going in to have sex vs a couple that is going in to help disability or just to sit down and give opinions. Know that it may be against company policy because others have abused the privilege so don't get butt hurt if they don't let you. It's really nice to see the concerned replies from people wanting to make sure that it's still okay, but it's very likely that you are fine. For those of you that ask about only x act, or what about here or whatever, sure it might be better, but you are still trying to work around doing something rude by saying that you will do something slightly less rude. 

Edit 3: Last edit. I do want to clarify that there is  absolutely nothing wrong with exhibition kink or fetish. This post is in no way meant to shame anyone or even accuse those that have done this of malice. I simply thought that the couples I do see coming into my fitting room hadn't fully realized our side  of things, and would like to save a lot of headache all around. Thanks everyone for the upvotes to get this seen. Gilded twice and showing up when you sort by top of all time (less than 24hrs no less) is pretty awesome.

2194,I had sex with my husband for the first time in a year.,7413,"24F. This is going to be a long one but I wanted to share my story so that other people who have gone through something similar know that there is hope and that they’re not alone. 

When I was 16-20 years old I dated a guy who abused me in every way possible, just short of beating. He used me for sex. It was always about him. It was always coerced and there were many times that he downright raped me and made me believe that it was normal and that I “owed” it to him. He hurt me during sex and bragged about it to his friends. I was able to escape when I was 20, but I had scars. I was scared of sex. I thought all men were the same and just wanted one thing from me. I was in college at the time, but I never went out. I kept dating to a minimum. I had a general fear of men.

Fast forward to last year. I was newlywed and my husband has been super understanding and amazing about the whole thing. Ever since I met him he never wanted to push me or do anything I wasn’t comfortable with to the point that we actually stopped having sex for a long time because he could read on my face that I was just waiting for it to be over. He didn’t feel comfortable having sex if it was only good for him. We had a long talk about how he wanted a hiatus from sex and that I should seek treatment and he would be there to support me. I didn’t realize that sex was supposed to be good for me too. I didn’t realize I had a problem until we had this talk. So I agreed to seek help for the sake of our relationship.

I tried several therapists and self help books but didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere until I started seeing a sexologist a couple months ago. She has helped me work through the trauma and my resulting attitudes towards men and sex. She gave me exercises that I have been working on to help me reframe sex in my mind. She made me realize that I was healing for me, not for my husband. She helped me realize that my pleasure matters and if I didn’t care about myself and healing for my own sake, I would never be able to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband. I mattered.

Flash forward to last night. My husband and I were making out in bed. I started making out with him again a week ago because I felt ready to start being physical again but wanted to ease into it. I wasn’t planning to have sex last night but it felt natural. The whole time he kept reassuring me how everything was okay, how he wasn’t going to hurt me, how he cared about me and wanted me to feel good, and that I mattered. That last one was the most important. He reassured me that he knew that my pleasure mattered and that I was in control. It was so hot and so comforting at the same time. We both came together and I cried afterwards as he held me because that was the first time I had ever had truly consensual and fulfilling sex. 

Many times throughout this process I thought rather hopelessly that I would never be comfortable with sex. That I was damaged beyond repair. I am so relieved now that I see change is happening and also so proud of myself for how far I’ve come since the abuse.

EDIT: I am overwhelmed by all of the love and support I have received. I truly wasn’t expecting it. Thank you. I have also received some messages and comments from people who have been or are in my situation. I made this post specifically for you. I want you to know that you are not broken. If your relationship has love you can overcome anything. Trauma is different for everybody but with the right tools it can be overcome. I’m so happy that this post has touched hearts and stand in solidarity with you all. 

EDIT 2: A few people have asked how I managed to find a gem of a man and marry him while simultaneously being afraid of men and scarred from my experience. The answer is that I got lucky. I stumbled into the right one. I met my husband 1 year after I escaped my abusive ex. He never pushed me and I felt safe with him. We didn’t even kiss until the 9th date. He is amazing and was more than okay with taking things slow for me. We started having sex as well, but once he got to know me better he started to see that I wasn’t really present and not actually enjoying it, hence the hiatus and therapy.

EDIT 3: A couple people have asked for examples of the exercises my sexologist gave me. The one that meant the most to me actually didn’t have to do with sex. It was writing a letter to my abusive ex with everything I wanted to say to him. You’re not actually supposed to send it because the less contact with the abuser the better. But I had a lot of pent up justified anger and I wasn’t letting it out. I didn’t even realize I had it until I started going to therapy. I sat down and wrote the meanest and angriest letter I could. Everything I had ever wanted to say to him. Then I burned it, and I was able to move on from the anger. 
I later learned that my anger was manifesting in my relationship to all men in general, so letting it go improved my emotional relationship with my husband, even though I had never been angry with him personally.

Another exercise that helped was one where I took long baths and spent a lot of time getting to know myself and becoming comfortable with my sexuality. Previously I had felt ashamed of my body and of my sexuality. Both of these attitudes had been installed by my abuser so he could control me. I spend many weeks just getting comfortable with myself, finding out what I liked and what I didn’t like. Slowly learning that there was nothing to be ashamed of.",False,sex
2195,I just had a sexual experience that broke my heart and made me cry like a baby [sexual damage],7293,"I'm a sex worker. Today, I got messaged by a guy. A 25yo virgin wants to lose his virginity. So after some vetting, we arrange to meet up at a hotel.

One thing gave me pause and it was that this guy is really, really physically attractive. Stereotypically so. Literally tall, dark, handsome. If I met him just out in the world and he told me he modeled, I'd have believed it. 

So then some of the most emotionally gut wrenching sex happened. He just coudln't get out of his head. The best way I can describe it was like he was cramming for a test tomorrow and he already knee he was going to fail that class. He wanted to do well so badly. It wasn't so much awkward as it was heartbreaking. Eventually, after me trying to co fort him and coach him, he just got off of me, sat on the edge of the bed for a minute, and started to cry and tell me I could go.

In that moment, i felt this overwhelming sense of sorrow. What he was feeling was so authentic and painful that I knew I had to be there for him. I scooted up next to him and held him. He asked me to please let him go and he said he felt worthless and like a loser.

I sat there and told him that I would leave if he really wanted me to, but that I would really like if he spoke to me about what he was feeling. At this point I was crying so I think that made him feel more comfortable.

He told me that he was raised religious, didnt say which, and that he was trying to wait until he was married for sex. He said he was recently in a year long relationship where it eventually came up and his religious gf broke up with him. It got back to him that she did it because of his lack of experience. 

He said he felt sex was ruined for him. That it was tied to him feeling inadequate and like he wasn't a real man with any value. He said that everyone his age learned how to have sex 10 years ago and that he was waiting for a woman who wasn't waiting for him. 


His plan was to pay for sex. He was going to keep going from sex worker to sex worker to build some experience but that he ended up just hating himself the entire time he was trying to have sex with me. Before I could respond to him, he hurried and put his clothes on and left.

He gave me a very suicidal vibe and i must have called him more than 50 times. Sent like 10 texts. Idk why but i just felt so scared for him. Still haven't gotten a response. I dont even know this guy and i feel so scared and sad for him. Such a heartbreaking story. I just want to hold on to him and tell him hes not worthless. ",False,sex
2196,"My friend and I did the test—how unsanitary is it, really, to “eat ass”?",7205,"My friend and I are interested in science. We also think that rimjobs are fun to give (me) and receive (her).

She does molecular biology and has plenty of experience using lab equipment to examine bacteria and fungal pathogens. The procedure to study how disgusting a given surface is, is pretty straightforward—you’ve probably done this yourself in middle school science class.

Using multiple swabs (to get a good average), we tested several surfaces: 

-a “clean” kitchen counter 

-my dick, her vulva

-both of our upper backs

-both of our anuses after showering and washing in there with soap.

2197,“You should see your body from this angle”,7046,"This is just a post to remind everybody that our bodies are not perfect. Maybe we have stretch marks, or loose skin, jiggly thighs, or a squishy tummy. Maybe our boobs hang down in certain positions and maybe we avoid looking in the mirror when we have sex. I know I have all of these problems. 

Last night my partner and I were fooling around. I wasn’t exactly feeling it, since my period was on its way, I hadn’t showered and we had just ate dinner. I climbed on top of him and all of a sudden he held me in place, looked up at me, and I mean, *really looked* and says “you should see your body from this angle”. He said it with so much love and lust in his voice and now I’m sitting here a day later and I can’t get his words out of my head.

This man, this beautiful man, who I think is a hundred times out of my league, loves my body. Like, really loves it. When I think about what he would see from his angle, I picture large thighs positioned on either side of him, a tummy that is not flat, large breasts that hang down. Maybe a double chin and a crazy mess of curly hair. He looks up at me and sees a beautiful woman, who has soft skin and curves,  a big smile on my face, and a body that’s capable and wanting to have sex with him.

I love every single inch of my partners body. I think he’s the sexiest man to walk the earth. He has a fantastic ass and strong arms. He has a soft but defined stomach, a smile that gives me butterflies, and a great head of hair. He’s tall and beautiful. I know there’s parts of his body he doesn’t love, but I’m blind to them all. To me, he’s perfect the way he is. He turns me on like nobody else ever has. So why can’t I do the same to him?

So this is just an appreciation post for our partners and our bodies. We really do see the worst in ourselves. We focus in on the things that we wish we could improve. This is a shout-out to all of the partners who make their SOs feel appreciated and sexy. So take your partners word for it that they find you desirable. Don’t let yourself get in your head and be the reason you don’t let loose and have a great time. Start to appreciate and love your body as much as your partner does.



Edit: I love this sub so much. I love reading all of your comments and I love all of you! You guys are all beautiful, and the human form as a whole is mesmerizing, regardless of the size, shape, colour, weight or so-called flaws we have. Keep being sexy and don’t let it hold you back ❤️",False,sex
2198,What I Have Learned,7033,"I'm in my 60s, which makes me older than nearly everyone here.  I've been reading posts here for a while (never too old to learn something), and want to offer a few things I've learned 40+ years of sexual engagement.  Apologies in advance if this is boring.

1.  Porn is not real life, unless porn is your career.  You aren't a porn star, and it's wrong to expect that your spouse/partner is.  If you're both into it, fine, but if one of you isn't then back away from the porn before it ruins your relationship.

2.  Work out your preferences, kinks, fantasies and other expectations BEFORE you become engaged or married.  Agree ahead of time what you're okay with, and more importantly, what you're not willing to do.  Wanting to bail on a marriage five years into it because you've just decided that your wife should do gangbangs but she doesn't want to is just a stupid thing.

3.  Monogamy is erotic, if you make it so.  It takes work and open communications, but it's possible and good. 

4.  Very few people are wired for threesomes, group sex, swaps, etc.  Very. Few.  Those who are tend to be waaaay over-represented in forums.  Don't think that it's typical or simple behavior because you read about it all the time.  If you and a partner are going to try it, do it before you marry so you don't wind up wrecking a marriage in the aftermath.  And know before you begin exactly what the risks are.

5.  Get married if you want regular, dependable sex.  Work out in advance where your libidos are set, high medium, or low, and make sure you are are compatible. 

6.  Then keep yourselves in shape and attractive.  Bathe, groom, and dress like adults.  Work out.  Eat just enough to maintain energy and not get fat.  Stay interesting.  Read books.  Talk about ideas. Make plans together.  Share in the work around your place.  

7.  ""She's got great boobs, we're going to get married"" and ""Wow, he's got tats, abs and a nice dick"" may be the two worst reasons humans can think of to get married.  That stuff all changes over time.  Think hard about what a good marriage looks like 20 years down the road and aim at that.

8.  Note that I said married, I didn't say living together.  Marriage takes courage and commitment, something a person you love deserves.  It's erotic.  Living together means one of you is going to bail as soon as something better comes along.  You can't build on that. There's no equity, no romance.  EDIT:  Women view living together as a steppingstone to marriage, while men view it as a way to avoid marriage, so there's a baked in conflict.  Link to essay that cites several studies about living together vs. marriage.  http://wingnutwatch.typepad.com/marriage/2010/10/research-findings-that-show-cohabiting-couples-break-up-at-much-higher-rates-than-married-people.html

9.  Learn the art of excellent quickies.  Say you're working, you've got kids, etc., and the hours long bang-a-thons you had before kids are now few and far between.  Don't despair, quickies are terriffic.  In bed, in the shower, in the kitchen, at odd times when you're together briefly, and so forth.  They are a great way to remain sexually connected with each other.

10.  If one of you loses interest in sex, talk talk talk talk and then talk some more.  Don't accuse, don't demand, don't issue ultimatums.  There is a reason or there are reasons for losing interest, find them and treat them accordingly. 

11.  Never yell (except in delight).  If you are going to yell, stop, walk away for a while and ask yourself why.  Start with your own expectations and move from there.  Yelling causes an argument, someone has to lose any argument, and you sure as hell don't want yourself or you partner to spend the next week or month feeling like a loser.  That kills relationships.

11.  You didn't invent sex.  Weird, right?  Humans have been having sex with each other since there were humans, some 250,000 years ago.  Oral isn't new,  anal isn't new, orgasms (or their lack) aren't new.  Multiple partners aren't new, one-nighters aren't new. Jealousy isn't new.  Being gay or bi isn't new.  In fact, until about the early 1900s sex was usually in conditions you'd not like.  People were usually covered in dirt, shit, sweat, fleas, flies, ticks, hair, grease, etc.  No tampons or pads. No soft beds, no soap, no waxing, no mood lighting, no tubs and showers, no Barry White music, no air conditioning, no condoms, no UTI prescriptions, no yeast infection prescriptions.  We're lucky that our ancestors were diligent, all because sex is good!",False,sex
2199,Life hack for initiating sex with your partner - a simple scale,7027,"I posted this in another thread and was told it should have its own post because it's a helpful tip :)

Sometimes, initiating sex in a long-term relationship is tricky.  So I devised this simple method to make communication about it easier:  a scale of 1-5.

&#x200B;

1 - not at all in the mood

2 - prefer no (but could be turned)

3 - neutral

4 - prefer yes (but won't be super disappointed if it doesn't happen)

5 - strongly in the mood

&#x200B;

So sometimes I'll just say, I'm feeling about a 4 right now, how about you?  If he says he's at 2, for example, I can decide whether I want to put in the work of warming him up, and if not, we can just go to bed.  No discussion really required unless we want one.  It works in almost all situations!  It's lightweight and easy to implement.  Hope it might help a few of you :)

&#x200B;

Edit:  thanks for the gold!

&#x200B;

Edit:   I see a lot of people saying things like, use your words!  Just ask!  It should be a simple yes/no!  The whole reason this scale came about is, sometimes it’s NOT a simple yes or no. Sometimes it’s...

\- “yes I’d be up for it but I’m tired so you’d have to be on top”

\- “not really but if it means a lot to you tonight, I can change that”

\- “I'd love it but I know you have an early morning so I won’t be upset if you don’t ”

\- etc etc

This scale can communicate all of these things so easily. It's not a substitute for real conversations.  It’s simply a shortcut!  Sometimes you don't want to have a drawn-out conversation, you just want to know where your partner stands.",False,sex

&#x200B;

Asmongold spent years ( as did a lot of people ) begging blizzard to release classic wow servers, For many reasons.. 

community.. 

the leveling experience..

the RPG elements that disappeared throughout the years..

fun.. 

the old zones..

Grouping up with other players all the time...

There's a million reasons we all wanted classic wow but I think it's really sad that he and many streamers shit talked BFA forever and said they would play classic differently only to go around begging for gold and items.  

They spent YEARS saying ""  WE'RE FINALLY GOING HOME BOYS!!! ""  "" WOW IS ALIVE AGAIN "" .. "" WOW IS BACK BABY "" 

&#x200B;

.. Only to beg for gold and items from other players after saying they strictly wouldn't.   

...Only to spam Scarlet Monastery to level. 

...Only to beg for gold for your first mount when you said you wouldn't

...Only to say "" CAN I GET THAT? "" whenever an item drops.

...Only to say  "" I don't want to do that quest it doesn't give good enough loot ""

...Only to do the same exact things and behave the same way you do on retail

&#x200B;

You had a second chance to re live classic wow and you threw it all away.    

You can't use the excuse "" but I decided to roll on a pvp server sooooo I don't want to be behind...""  Because we know that's an excuse. Don't even try to justify your lie. 

&#x200B;

You asked for legacy servers for years but when they came around you just weren't strong enough to do it without begging for gold and items.   

At the end of the day,  Who cares he's just one person.  But as a top WoW streamer it's sad.

2249,"I thought I was useless, but then...",14213,"I was questing in the Barrens, a lowly level 18 tauren warrior.  My weapon was trash, but I was pacing along when I accepted ""Weapons of Choice"" at Camp Taurajo.

The quest was red, but the mace reward was juicy.  A whopping 17+ dps would amount to a 60% damage increase for me.  Could I do it?

Absolutely and unequivocally not.  I died multiple times to the level 23 mobs before throwing in the towel and dodging quillboar to mine for tin in the area.

A level 24 priest appears and is melting mobs.  I humbly ask if I can tag along and he agrees.  I laid hamstring on the mobs to keep them under control and leached the juicy exp, hoping for the three quest drops necessary to complete my quest (absolute garbage drop rate).

He killed his quest mob after 5 minutes but decided to help me out while he grinded to 25.  Greens were dropping like mad and despite my protests he left them for me to pick up on FFA loot.  ""It's all you, man.""

30 minutes later he dings and I still need 1 more drop.  It's taking forever and I say goodbye - but no, he wants to finish the deed.  What a nice guy.

Another 20 minutes and we finally finish up.  I thank him profusely, offering my help in the future but knowing itll take me another month to hit 25.  I'll never be able to repay him.

We part ways as I mine the last couple of veins and he starts back up the Gold Road.  He's still in my group and all of a sudden I see his health bar plummet to 20% and a hamstring/rend appears on his portrait.  He is flagged for PvP, and a warrior had him in his clutches.

I dart toward the road as fast as I can.  I arrive on the scene and the human warrior had been feared by a psychic scream.  /rude emotes were flying from my compatriot as he turned tail to run.  But it was useless.  The warrior began mounting up to chase him down.  It was only a matter of seconds before my new friend would be laying on the ground.

I am running toward the warrior, dodging hyenas and just hoping I can do *something*.  I tell him to run for his life, and whatever happens just dont stop - I'm a willing sacrifice.

The warrior's mount animation completes and an epic armored warhorse appears.  I am desperately mashing my charge in the hope that I can at least distract him for a moment.

I dash forward as soon as the button lights up and to my surprise the charge stun wasn't resisted.  Amazing.  It gives me the split second I need to pop blood rage and mash hamstring.  Fat chance, I thought.   But the first one lands and he has no choice but to dismount and turn his fury toward me.

He lays a huge hit on me as I spam the customary emotes and shuffle around him, waiting to die as I laugh and scream in complete hysterics at my computer screen.  But just then I realize - while he is hamstrung I am free to run.

Im at 42 hp and I take off in the other direction.  He swaps to berserker stance to put the nail in the coffin - but the second I see the icon I run back in his direction.  I'm in the sweet spot.  7 yards out.  Too far to swing at me, and too close to land a charge.

I run and strafe forward and backward as he tries to catch me, and I can see it - he is completely lost. 

The panic sets in, and then the rage builds.  He swaps from berserker back to battle, then back to berserker.  Five stance changes later and the hamstring wears off - he catches me with the final hit.  I am slain.

By now, my new friend was halfway to camp Taurajo and managed to duck onto a side path, completely shocked and feverishly asking me what in the holy hell happened.

He is safe, and though my lifeless body sits blood- soaked in the dust beneath the harsh southward eye of the Barrens sun...I am victorious.

We put up a bunch of plants, costing thousands but my parents thought it would be worth it. A week later my parents awoke to the plants completely chopped down. My father was furious, and marched down to our neighbors house. He told my father the plants were on his property line, therefor he had total right to take them down.

 My father died on Father’s Day 2012. He was divorced and living alone, and I am an only child. So that means that I had to wrap up all of his affairs. This story centers around us trying to get his utilities canceled.

I called in to see what we had to do to get them to cancel. The lady I spoke with on the phone said to send in his certified death certificate. I sent in the certified copy of his death certificate the next day. The next month got another bill. I called again and a new woman answered. She said that because I wasn’t on the account that she had to speak with the account holder. I informed her that the account holder was dead but she wouldn’t budge. I had to make an appointment with a supervisor so she could speak to him herself in person. 

I showed up at the board of public utilities with another death certificate and HIS ASHES IN THE CLEAR BAG that they returned his remains in. I plopped them down on the center of her desk and said when she talked to him to tell him that I loved him for me. The woman went pale, flew out her chair, and called the cops. 

When they showed up she claimed that I had assaulted her. And yes my dads remains were still sitting in the middle of her desk with the death certificate. The cops questioned me as to why I would do that. I told them the story. The supervisor’s boss was called in and they all stepped away from the desk for a private talk. While they were talking the cops came over to talk to me. They said that I shouldn’t take human remains out in public, but there was no laws that were broken. I said that I agreed with them that it was extreme, but she insisted to speak with him in person. By then they were done talking between themselves. The supervisor’s boss kissed up to me and got it taken care of.

But the story isn’t over yet! I had to call back a few days later to get utilities back to the house in my name. When the person on the phone saw the address and my name, I was immediately put on hold. The supervisors boss that finally helped me got on the phone. She sucked up to me and waived all of the fees that come with setting up utilities. Just as the call was ending, she informed me that she was again so sorry for the employees lack of compassion. She said that the employee was terminated and again she is so very sorry. 

TLDR: Ignorant employee asked to speak to dead dad. Had a meeting in person, brought his ashes, got her fired.

 I asked my boss “can all the animals eat asparagus?” “Can they eat cherries” his replies were “probably” or “I don’t know” so I asked if he would look it up.

My department manager didn't know I was gay when he hired me and he figured it out when he asked me who the guy that was waving to me was. He made a weird face, not necessarily disgusted but you get the point.

Anyway anytime my boyfriend would enter the store after that, he would keep his eye on him. Now if he were to wave to me my manager would start to berate me and try and make it out like im slacking, when im just stocking shelves and smiling in his direction, nothing bad at all. He didn't care at all prior to learning he's my boyfriend.

After a week he has a private talk with me saying my boyfriend is causing too much of a distraction and he should shop here while im on shift and that if something didnt change i might be let go.

I was mad, told my boyfriend about it, he was even more mad. I didn't really want to make a big deal out of it though, this is a temp job probably wont even have it longer than a year or two. So i decided to prank my manager instead of getting into legal or corporate stuff. We have other gay friends that shop there, crazy enough we look just like regular people so no one would realize, including my manager.

Sure my boyfriend won't shop there but what about other gay people? That shouldnt matter he just doesnt want my SO distracting me at work...

So, i mentioned what happened to my 5 friends who mentioned it to their friends and so on.

I had a customer come in complaining about a vibration. I put the vehicle on the lift and checked the front end. I found a nearly broken tie rod and a faulty rack and pinion. So basically the passenger side front wheel was not fully secured to the steering system and would soon break and cause the wheel to be completely disconnected from the steering. 

I told the customer how much the repair would be and told her it was unsafe to drive. She asked me to put it back together so she could leave. I told her that I could not do that because if it broke after I let her leave, I could be held liable. She started yelling and screaming about calling the cops and suing me and how her cousins brother knows a guy who's related to the chief of police and I'll be arrested. 

She calls the police and they come out, I show the officers the vehicle and they understood the safety concern. They told me to just put the car down and let her leave. I did and even made her sign a statement declining crucial safety repairs.

I was so happy seeing her car get towed.

The cops told her it was against the law to drive it, the state laws back then allowed me to do exactly what I did, I offered to discount the price of the repair and take payments, she still refused.

2282,"Restaurant employee amuses himself, delights me and my kids",41234,"Yesterday I decided to take my kids to an international chain restaurant.  In this restaurant, the kids' meal comes with ice cream.  But, you have to serve yourself.

That was a problem because there weren't any bowls beside the ice cream machine.

So I thought, ""I know what to do.  I'll simply ask an employee for some bowls.""  And that's just what I did.

So he turns to look at the vast array of bowls behind him, some sauce-sized, some entree salad-sized, and many in between.  And we realize that neither of us knows what size the kids' ice cream is intended to be.

So he thought, ""I know what to do.  I'll simply ask a manager.""  And he says, ""hey boss, what do we put the kids' ice cream in?""

Without turning around, the boss says ""a fucking bowl, what do you think?""

""Ya, but what size of bowl?""

The boss, with his inimitable charm, tact, and grace, says ""JUST FUCKING GIVE HIM A BOWL.""

The employee looked back at the bowls, and then I saw him get a big grin over his face.

""I apologize about that, sir.  I think it's probably these ones,"" he says, as he hands me two of the largest bowls they have in the restaurant, practically giggling with glee.

My children were similarly delighted.

The manager walked by when we were half way through and made a noise like a startled opossum, but said no actual words.

2283,"""I demand to be put in a seat that is able to recline""",40666,"A few years ago I was on a flight from LA to Singapore (takes 16+ hours).  I'm a tall dude - around 6'3"" (~190cm) - so I don't fit very well in economy class seats.  On most planes my knees are often very close or right up against the seat in front of me.  This makes it impossible for the person in front of me to recline their seat, which usually isn't a problem once the person in front of me sees how cramped I am in those tiny seats.  

However for this particular flight, the man in front of me was not having it.  He tried to recline his seat, but couldn't because my legs were there.  He turns around and sees what's happening and asks me something along the lines of, ""Do you mind letting me put my seat back?""  

I respond with, ""I wish I could but I physically can't.  I'll do my best to give you as much space as I can, but it won't be much.""  At this point he starts to get angry and just starts pushing as hard as he can back on his seat.  Needless to say, this was not particularly pleasant for me.  I ask him to please stop, and he says, ""I'll stop when I can put my seat back.""

I decide I'll just wait him out; he'll eventually get tired.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, he calls a flight attendant over and proceeds to demand a new seat.  The flight attendant tells him there are no available seats and he will have to deal with it.  He demands to speak to the pilot.  

So the flight attendant goes up front to talk to the cockpit.  Keep in mind that throughout this he is still pressing with all his might against my knees, with only short breaks to yell at the flight attendant.  After a couple of minutes, the co-pilot (he wanted to speak to the pilot and wan't happy about this) comes back and tries to explain to the man that he can't change seats because there are no other coach seats free.  The man continues to demand a seat that is able to recline, give me an upgrade, this is unacceptable, making a scene etc.  

The co-pilot finally gives in and says while looking at the man, ""Sir, would you like to sit up in business class?""  

The man stands up and mutters something similar to, ""Fucking finally.""  To which the co-pilot responds, ""Sir, sit down.  I wasn't talking to you.""  He turns to me and repeats, ""How would you like a seat in business class?""

I have, to this day, never seen someone as furious as the man as I walked past him to my new business class seat (with free drinks).",False,MaliciousCompliance
2284,"Sorry ma'am, of course your son can try the 7M SHU Hot Sauce",39761,"I work in a hot sauce store in a busy outlet mall. We're a well-liked locally owned business and have many loyal return customers, but at this particular location we also get a lot of tourists who are curious about our challenge items, or ""Hot Ones"" products. 

We have a large variety of samples available every day. Literally like 100 hot sauces, 50+ bbq/wing sauces just out on the table and we can pull another 50+ bottles or so from the fridge if one's open. 

Every so often we get people who come into the store and ask to try the hottest sauce. They love jalapenos in their burritos and have eaten habaneros straight and they're ready to enter the ring, swallow some sauce and gain the admiration of a couple friends and bystanders at the cost of a stomach ache. We usually try to guide them to the 10th hottest sauce in the store, burn them with it, and move on to something mild or medium suited to their taste.

Today while I was selling items to people who were actually paying for things, a 10-or-so year old boy enters the store. I always get wary when children enter the store alone because it is full of glass bottles. They usually dart straight for the shelves and pick something up, but this child came barreling towards me like a bullet. 

While I make change for the couple buying some sauce, he calls out to me, ""Excuse me!"", in a horrendous whiny pitch. I ignore the rude interruption and continue my conversation with my customers. He parrots it again twelve times or so back to back as I thank these people and get them out of the store. Finally, I turn to him, ""How can I help you?"". Where the fuck are this kid's parents.

""Hi can I try the hottest sauce in the store."" Not this shit again. I am not dealing with this, not with a 10 year old kid. I explain to him that the hottest sauce on the table is Hellboy: Right Hand of Doom. It's spiked with a 6.66 Million scoville extract, and honestly if you're not experienced with this kind of stuff more than just a tiny bit can really mess up a good part of your day. Take my word for it.

I explain to him he has to be 19 years old to try it and sign a waiver (which is bullshit, but I'm off in 30 minutes so fuck this kid), and instead guide him to a tasty fermented habanero that he coughs his eyes out on before explaining to me that he could handle the Right Hand of Doom because his dad eats spicy peppers with him all the time. ""Okay."" I say. He leaves, thank God.

15 Minutes later I'm interrupted by another customer. This time a gigantic woman, in a blue blouse, she's set next to my sample table like a giant blueberry blocking up 20% of my floor space. ""Excuse me!"" Apple doesn't fall far. The customers I'm with are polite and excuse me to speak to her. ""You didn't let my son try the sauce!"" 

I explain to her that it has extract in it several hundreds times hotter than anything he has ever eaten and that it can cause him severe discomfort and that I will not let him try it in my store. I explain that she is free to purchase the sauce and have him try it at home if she so wishes. She explains to me that she married a Mexican man and that I wouldn't believe the things we ate in ""New Mexico City"" where he grew up. When I asked what they had eaten there she told me ""Things hotter than anything we have in the store"". 

At this point her daughter interrupts our conversation, I shit you not, ""Excuse me!""

""What?"" I'm getting annoyed. I was annoyed from the second I saw the kid and now he's back 20mins later with three of him. ""Why do you sell Valentina it's not even a hot sauce?"" Jesus Christ. Aren't you from Mexico? It says fucking Salsa Piquante on the God damned bottle. It's 5:50, I'm off at 6. I've had enough.

""How about this, you can try the sauce and if it's as mild as you think, I'll let him try it."" She agreed and grabbed her sample stick. I reached for the Right Hand of Doom, and unscrewed the cap. It's nuclear aroma sending memories of aches to my stomach. As she goes to dip the stick into the sauce, I warn her to ""only take a small amount"". She grins at me and dips the stick all the way into the sauce. Trap card, bitch. She slaps it into her mouth.

Immediately she looks uneasy before she throws herself into pure agony. She is coughing, swinging her head back and forth, trying desperately to speak, but she cannot muster any words. She dropped her sample stick in all the chaos. After a solid few minutes of coughing and dry heaving, she manages a single word, ""water."" I explain to her that water won't help her now. My relief walks through the door just in time to witness the finish.

She tells me that the only reason she is coughing is because ""it went down the wrong pipe."" She then immediately vomits into our garbage can. She apologizes for ""spitting up"" like she didn't just rocket launch half a litre of chum into my trashcan and then leaves without saying anything else.

2285,"Was told to ""actually read the policy"". So I did.",39742,"I work for an office and we have an 8 week busy season with mandatory overtime (12-14hrs/day).  During this time, the company agrees to reimburse us for dinner, up to $13/meal.  We just have to submit a claim with our receipts at the end of the busy season.

&nbsp;

Food options around my work aren't great so I usually brought my dinner from home.  But sometimes I was too tired to cook after a long day so out of the 8 weeks, I purchased maybe 10 meals.  3 of those meals I spent $13.50, going $0.50 over the limit.  This resulted in a whopping $1.50 overage which my manager said it was no big deal and that I could include on my expense claim.  He signed off on it and everything.

&nbsp;

A few days after I submitted my report Head Office emailed me saying they rejected my expense claim and that I could resubmit after I removed the $1.50 overage.  I wrote back saying my manager was fine with the $1.50 overage and even signed off on it, and they responded by telling me that they do not allow overages under any circumstances, that the $1.50 must be removed or they wouldn't approve any of my meal expenses.  They ended their email with the advice that I should ""actually read the company policy next time"".

&nbsp;


Fine, they were right and I was wrong.  So I decided I'd read the policy very thoroughly before redoing my expense claim.

&nbsp;


Yes, the policy clearly stated a $13/maximum on purchased meals.  Oh, and what's this?  The policy also allows a $10 per diem for meals you bring from home.

&nbsp;


I very happily removed the $1.50 overage and added an additional $300 for the 30 meals I brought from home.

I should read the company policy more often!

EDIT:  Thank you for the gold benevolent redditor!  It's my first time.

Some of you are asking if I got paid the $300 and the answer is yes.  Many are suggesting the person was sincerely trying to help me out, but I'm not 100% sure because they were so snippy in their email.  Also, when we were emailed the meal policy at the beginning of busy season there was no mention of the per diem and no one else in my department knew about it.

2286,“Can’t you just unload around me?”,37494,"So this happened earlier today and was too perfect to not share with you guys. I work in construction as the foreman for a new house build. The location is kinda strange, the house is 250 feet up a hill via a foot path only. All of our materials have to come up this foot path by hand, it’s a pain in the ass to manually carry, quite literally, an ENTIRE HOUSE up this hill. One of our saving graces is having the two parking spots on the street at the bottom of this hill marked with official No Parking signs. Unfortunately there is an elementary school about half a block away and the parents of children seem to regularly (at least twice a day) think it’s ok to park in our spots. Now I consider myself a reasonable person, so if someone is parked in the spots and we don’t have a delivery or a need to park a truck I will let it go. If we need the spots and there’s someone parked there, however, I will ask them to move nicely and most of the time they do so immediately. Until today. 

I get a phone call from the lumber delivery truck that is en route to our location, he says he’ll be there in about two or three minutes. I let him know I will meet him at the street and make sure he has space to park. He’s carrying all of the material to frame the roof of our house, which is a lot of really big lumber and will take easily an hour to bring up the hill, so naturally I didn’t want him parked in the middle of the street with his hazards on for an hour, when we have a perfectly good parking spot for him. As I begin my trip down the hill, I notice there is a school parent sitting in her car idling, assuming she’s just waiting to pick up her child, I walk up to her car and politely let her know that she is parked in a no parking zone and we really need her to clear it to park a delivery truck. She scoffs at me and rudely states back, “I’ll just be a few minutes, and your truck isn’t here, take a chill pill dude.” Before I can respond, a giant lumber truck comes around the corner and I wave to him, and then gesture towards him to the woman in the car who has now put her window back up to ignore me. I put on my best customer service smile and wave at her through the window, she put it down halfway and angrily shouts “WHAT!” By now the truck has pulled up alongside her car and I politely ask her again, with a stronger tone of voice to move her vehicle, reminding her that she is illegally parked in a tow away zone. Then she gives me this wonderful idea, she says, “Can’t you guys just unload around me? Jesus, it’s not that hard.” I give her another smile and walk away, a brilliant plan forming in my head. I instruct the delivery driver to park as closely to her as possible and block her in with the porta potty that is at one end of our reserved spots and the parked car that is parked just adjacent to our spots on the other end. He smiles because he immediately gets what I’m trying to do, and proceeds to expertly block this lady and her car into a little two parking spot jail. We unstrap the lumber and my guys begin humping material up the hill, meanwhile I call the police parking enforcement to let them know the situation. At this point in time I wasn’t trying to get her in trouble, I just wanted a record of why we were blocking part of the street so we don’t get in trouble with the city. The very friendly traffic officer lets me know that she can be there in about 30 minutes and deal with the situation for me, wonderful! As we continue to unload lumber the child of the parent shows up, and wouldn’t you know it Mom is just now realizing that the lumber truck is parked so close she can’t get out of her driver door to meet her kid. She awkwardly clambers across the inside of her car and stumbles out the passenger door, shooting glaring looks at me and the truck driver in the process. She loads her kid into the back and then begins to realize that she has no way of leaving. She comes storming up to myself and the driver and states, “I’m in a big hurry, you need to move your damn truck right now so I can go.” Before I can respond the driver gets a grin on his face and says, “Ma’am in order to unload the lumber on the truck we had to unstrap it, and per our company policy I’m not allowed to move the truck with any unsecured load on it. Sorry.” This sends her into near aneurysm levels of blood pressure, meanwhile I can barely contain my laughter. “Fuck your policy I have somewhere to be!” She barks back at him. 

At this point, with impeccably convenient timing the parking enforcement officer shows up and parks behind the truck. She doesn’t see the officer arrive and while the officer is still getting out of her vehicle I just casually say, “Can’t you just pull out around it? It’s not that hard.” With the biggest shit eating grin I’ve ever had I watch as she realizes that I just used her line on her. “Fuck you!” She yells, and storms back to her car and angrily clambers back in through the passenger door and into the drivers seat. At this point the officer is walking up to myself and the driver, before she can even introduce herself the Mom in the car slams it into reverse and stomps on the gas, crashing into our porta potty and knocking it over, and then throws the car into drive and tries to mount the curb and drive on the sidewalk. The officer, driver and I are staring in disbelief as she gets halfway over the curb and gets stuck. I can hear her screaming obscenities over the idling truck from inside her car. The officer promptly walks up to the door of the car and orders her out. My favorite part of the entire thing is watching her face go to shock as she realized she just did all of that in front of a police officer. She gets slapped in cuffs as the parking officer calls for a second unit and she is promptly sat on the very curb she tried to drive over. 

She sits on the curb yelling to the now two officers about how we told her she could stay there and that we never asked her to move. The traffic officer responds that she was the one who was originally called when she first refused to move and that she already knows what’s going on. While myself and the driver are giving a report to the second officer, my guys finish moving the remainder of the lumber and the driver finishes his statement and takes off to go back to the yard. By the end of the ordeal she was arrested, charged with Child Endangerment, (her kid was in the back of the car the whole time) Reckless Driving, Destruction of Property, (the porta potty) and Driving on a Suspended License. On top of all that she also got her car towed, the kid went home with his grandma and she went to spend some quality time in a cell. I never expected her to actually heed my advice to “Just pull out around it.” But I think next time she’ll probably think twice about parking in a tow away zone, if she ever gets a license again. 

TLDR: Rude lady parks in construction site reserved parking, asks us to unload around her, so we park blocking her to do so, gets mad when she now has no way out, crashes into our porta potty and tries to mount the sidewalk. Gets stuck, and the arrested by an officer who was on scene, and all with her child in the back seat.

2288,"Tenant asking Landlord (me) to ""Be More Professional""....",36069,"I am a small-time Landlord, with just 4 tenants. Earlier this year, I had two sisters that didn't respond to my requests to add of the gal's husband to the lease, though he was living with them. Not a BIG deal... but did I mention the pit bull they also brought home, without permission? I DO allow pets, and had previously approved their other dog. I asked nicely in person and by email in the months leading up to the malicious compliance...

&#x200B;

They also did not respond when I asked if they were happy there, and wanted to renew their lease for the following year. I asked again... Then I emailed them notice that I would start showing the unit 2 days later.

&#x200B;

I try to be a nice Landlord... I do. They had a newborn, as well, so I scheduled all of the showings within a 2 hour window on the same night so I could be in their space as little as possible. Also, because they had not responded, and it was now serious ""crunch time"" for getting another tenant and my spouse worked all the following two weeks during evening showing hours,  I had the delightful inconvenience of bringing my 2 and 6 year old children with me to the showings. Because I'm not a corporation - I'm a small-time family Landlord with kids. 

&#x200B;

Try to imagine how difficult it is to conduct business meetings with 2 kids, right? Then imagine staggering showings every fifteen minutes, with prospective tenants who are also bringing their own kids. Just to further clutter your imagination, this is an 800 square foot 2 bedroom apartment with a cozy entryway. So I arrive with my two kids, to find that my tenants are still at home, along with the husband, the newborn and the other sister's boyfriend. So that's 7 people in a small kitchen already. Then the first prospective tenants start arriving. Husbands, wives, with kids, and some showing up early so there's two sets of them. That's 14 people in a small kitchen...

&#x200B;

And I'm a mom. I have magical powers. So I'm holding my toddler, my daughter is safely under the dining table coloring, and I'm chatting with the prospective tenants and directing traffic while my actual tenants prepare to depart. If you didn't know this already, it's common practice in the US to leave the premises during real estate or apartment showings. This was their first apartment, so I actually emailed them ahead of time to let them know what is generally expected at showings (e.g. a relatively tidy apartment, and that they can leave, for their own convenience).   


They do eventually leave, after the boyfriend tells a prospective tenant that he, in fact, ALSO lives there. And I carry on with an exhausting scheduling of showings. And have my new tenants all picked out and lease signed by the next day. Awesome, right?

&#x200B;

The next night, I get a voicemail from the husband (who is NOT my tenant). I saved it, and just listed to it again, because it still gives me that same delightful shiver of malicious compliance..  In his voicemail, he told me how awful it was that MY children touched HIS infant's things (they didn't, because I keep my kids entertained with magical mommy toys, but prospective tenants also brought children), and how they had to sterilize everything to keep their infant from being sick, and how inconvenient it was to have showings with only 2 days notice, and how very unprofessional I was to bring my children, and *asked if I could just be more professional in the future*.

&#x200B;

You can hear it, can't you? The deep shiver of malicious compliance vibrating through my offended being.

&#x200B;

The next morning, I started issuing *professional* Lease Violation Notices. One for the extra residents of the unit (hubby and boyfriend). One for the extra dog. And a few additional ones for building concerns I noted during the showings.

&#x200B;

They ignored the violation notice, which I sent by certified mail and, thoughtfully, also by email. I decided to be even *more* professional 30 days later, and issue a 5-day notice to vacate. And I called their mom, who is their emergency contact, as an eviction notice IS an emergency. Did I mention that their lease was due to end just a few weeks later?  But it would be unprofessional of me to let these violations slide until then..

&#x200B;

Three days later, they'd magically sent me all the information I'd requested, removed the other dog, licensed the first dog, gotten the required pet insurance...   


They moved out on their lease termination date. And skipped out on their last electric bill, and left the unit in damaged condition. Despite my *professional* security deposit disposition statement and request for payment, they ignored those notices, until I stated I would proceed to small claims court by X date for the total due BEYOND their security deposit. On X date, they replied stating they ""didn't think it was fair"" that they should have to cover damages to the unit, or ""pay any more money"" toward their utility bill.

&#x200B;

Yep. Two months later, there we were in the lobby of the court house, sitting across from each other on uncomfortable waiting-room benches. They're laughing among themselves about how they're going to get their full security deposit back. And I'm quietly reviewing my presentation notes to the judge and my sizable stack of evidence, photographs, videos.... this was my first time in court, but I wasn't laughing. I was preparing.

&#x200B;

One hour later, we're back in the lobby and their mom is trying to write me a check for the full amount of the judgement. She doesn't have a pen. Her kids don't have a pen. I, however, have a pen. I cheerfully offer my pen. She writes the check and hands it to me, and... wait.... I hold my out my hand again. Got my pen back too.

&#x200B;

I was so proud of myself for not saying any of the sassy things in my head in that moment. You know why? Because I was being *professional*, as I'd been from the moment he'd left that voicemail.

&#x200B;

As a last note, I do acknowledge that it would have been better if I hadn't brought my children. However, if you have kids, you'll understand that sometimes, they simply have to go where you go. ",False,MaliciousCompliance
2289,Ex-girlfriend wants to cut off our electricity? No problem!,35144,"Hey, please tell me if this is inappropriate for the sub and I'll post it elsewhere.

I was living with my girlfriend and a roommate, and we split the cost of every bill evenly, even though each bill was in one person's name. Well, that was the idea, but I naively ""helped"" my girlfriend pay her part of the bills (i.e. paid completely for most of them). The rent was in my name, the electricity in my girlfriends', etc.

Well I eventually got tired of her crap (arguments, smelly gerbils, not doing chores), and we broke up. It was messy. She took ages to move out, making sure to mooch every penny she could before leaving.

When she left, I immediately started a new electricity account in my name. A week later, I got a letter of confirmation in the mail, but I also received the electricity bill for the last three months my ex was living with us. I opened it without thinking. We couldn't even pay it if we wanted to because the bill was in her name. I shot her a text:

Me:  Yo, you got the electricity bill in the mail. It's 120 bucks so come pick up $40 from each of us.

Ex:    Um where's the other $40? We agreed I wouldn't pay bills after I move out. (as if she did before)

Me:  You were still living here for the time period of the bill.

Ex:    This is bullshit, I'm not going to pay a thing. We had an agreement.

Me:   Well... you can come over to get our part, or you can pay it alone.

Ex:    The way I see it, you can either bring the $120 to my place or have fun in the dark lol.

Me:   You got me there!

At this point I realized that she doesn't know I started my own account with the electricity provider. She thought that by refusing to pay, the provider would cut our lights. Good way to mooch another $40 from us, right? But that's not quite what happened.

A few weeks later, I received another letter from elec. company with her name on it. Probably a late payment warning. I sent her a text to tell her, and she responded, ""lol why are you so desperate to talk to me. You know what you have to do :)""

Another letter came in for her. This one was probably late fees. I have to guess because I never opened them. I messaged her and she said, ""I thought I told you to never talk to me again.""  As you wish, ma'am!

More letters arrived, but from a new address. I Googled the new sender's address and found that they were debt collectors. Scary stuff. It's too bad I couldn't say a word to her.

Now about two or three months later, I received a phone call from my ex and I'm greeted by ""WHAT THE FUCC THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLING MY PARENTS' HOUSE I'VE GOT ALL THESE LATE FEES BAAHHHH DEBT COLLECTORS."" I told her if she wants our part of the bill, she knows what to do :)

Realizing that she had no other choice, she caved and came for the money. My roommate and I didn't give her a cent toward late fees, and I probably looked so fucking smug giving her my money for the last time.

2290,"""I will be playing this in front of the whole class"" lol okay",34149,"I was talking to some friends from undergrad and this story from my freshman year came up again. Having recently stumbled upon this subreddit (from r/StoriesAboutKevin, weirdly), I think this might belong?

Second semester of my freshman year, I was taking a music theory course. The professor was very serious about her job and this class was a bit of a weed-out class for students who wanted to pursue Music Education (I was taking it for fun). By the time the end of the semester rolled around, I got the feeling she didn't really like me much because I didn't pay attention in class but still got As on the homework/exams/playing tests (I'd played piano for a decade by this point), so she couldn't really punish me for anything since I wasn't disrupting the class, but was just a thorn in her side through lack of participation (thank god that wasn't part of our grade). Our final project was to find a poem we liked and craft a song using the poem as the lyrics. As she passes out the requirement sheet, she announced that she would be playing these for the class, so we need to put in effort so that we don't feel embarrassed by what she plays in front of everyone (about 30 people). She shoots a glance at me--the least involved student--as she says that, which I took as a challenge. I found a poem called [""A Minor Bird""](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-minor-bird/) and decided to craft my masterpiece in the key of E-flat minor. The reasoning: 6 of the 7 notes are lowered a half-step. So it's not a matter of thinking ""everything I see is lowered,"" it's ""everything but one note is lowered,"" which is fairly hard to keep track of while sight-reading something that utilizes both hands on the piano (we were to hand them in at the beginning of class and she would go through the stack and play them, without practicing first. It's a freshman-level class. How hard could it be?)

I spent weeks working on this because I wanted to make sure it was both well-written *and* an absolute bitch to play. I had upperclassmen take a look at it to make sure everything was labeled correctly, and they told me I was the most magnificent bastard ever because this prof had irked most of the students in the department who had taken her class.

Then the day comes. We all turn our papers in, and I'm visibly excited by everything. The prof comes in, and goes full Dolores Umbridge--""I certainly hope everyone met the requirements and put care into their work. If not, we'll soon find out!""--goes to the piano and pulls the first paper off of the stack, and makes some comments about it that aren't negative but are a bit goading, regarding the amount of effort it seemed to take to write it. She (apparently) pulls mine up about 2/3 of the way, sits down to play it, and stops at the first chord. She looks around, makes eye contact with me and straight-up *glares* before regaining her composure and plunking through my piece. There's several chords that make a nice crunch before she corrects herself (that damn NOT-flat note tripped her up every time), and it sounds like whoever wrote this piece did a shit job because of how it sounded. At the end, the meek international student--who has Perfect Pitch--raises her hand, and goes ""Excuse me, Dr. <Music Instructor>? That piece just played... it has 6 flats in the key, yes?"" Prof: ""Yes, it did. I didn't quite expect that"" Student: ""You..didn't play all 6 flats, it didn't sound."" Prof turns, glares at me, and goes ""no, no I did not""

Got a 97% because she marked a chord label incorrect. Went back in and showed her that she missed the not-flat note in the chord, and that it was actually labeled correctly; got it changed to a 100%.

tl;dr Music professor 'threatened' to play our pieces in front of us so we would work harder on it. I wrote something she couldn't play.


Edit: I have the music, played by Finale NotePad, and have made an account just to upload it here: [Enjoy!](https://clyp.it/ehzbip53) Unfortunately, I have no idea where the sheet music is at this point. That class was Spring '09, and I've had a lot of life happen since then.

Edit 2: The sheet music is definitely not on my current computer. The mp3 source also says it was created via Melody Assistant, not Finale, in case anyone cares *that* much. The best I can provide for ""pics or it didn't happen"" is [this](https://imgur.com/X697fUt), which is just the text of the poem in a word document with the date. Nothing too exciting. I'm going to see if my parents can find my old laptop at their house, and I'll search for the sheet music on there, and I'll share it with everyone who has asked (both publicly and privately) for a copy of it!

Edit 2.5: With my new job in “the real world,” I haven’t had vacation time to go back to visit my parents to find said sheet music. I’ve had quite a few people message me/comment to ask for it, so I’m sorry to disappoint still. There have been a few other people in the comments who posted a link to their reverse-sheet music creations, and they look to be pretty close (the beginning starts with a pickup note on Beat 4, so that throws a lot of the computer-created versions off). I’ll post comments from the people who messaged me theirs, as well, because this post is about to be archived and I won’t be back home before then ",False,MaliciousCompliance
2291,"Because some people mistook us for a bank and complained, corporate changed the policy on $50 and $100s.",34107,"Despite the big bold sign written in such a way that even the North Sentinelese could understand it, almost everyone with $50s and $100s thinks they don't need no stinking bank and will just go to us to get that big bill broken down. 

Well it keeps wiping out our tills when they raise a fuss and eventually they called corporate. Their response was to have us rescind the policy and... carry more money in the tills. Obviously they have never worked a till in their lives otherwise they would know why we don't carry disgusting amounts of money in the register. 


But they didn't tell us we needed $20s and $10s. So we decide to start some malicious compliance. 

We go to the bank and their mouths twist into a grin like that of a Midnight Lycanroc when we tell them. We get *Dozens* of $5s and $1s... and wait.

2292,"""I don't work here anymore.....hey, boss, got an opening?""",33652,"Worked for a Medical Transportation company that had a contract with Medicaid.

One of their many rules was that you could not provide any assistance to the patient INSIDE of their house.

One elderly lady had an old house with a very small foyer that you had to climb three steps to get to the main floor.  The only other entrance was around back and up two and a half flights of rickety steps to an old deck that opened into a bedroom. 

Upstairs.  She's in a wheelchair.

Common sense says take her in the front door, up three stairs and she's home on the level she lives on.

Medicaid says take her up the outside stairs, dump her in the bedroom upstairs and let her worry about getting down to the living room level.

We ignored their policy and took her in the front door anyway.

A random inspection by a random inspector showed that we were not in compliance.

We appealed, the inspector came out and saw the different options and decided that we had no case for appeal.  Take her up the outside stairs.

Nope.  From then on, when the driver arrived at her house, he would get her out of the van in the sidewalk, and then get on the radio and tell the boss to shove his stupid job.

Now that he was no longer an employee, he was free to assist this lovely person into her front door and up the stairs.

Once finished, they would come back to the van, tell the boss they'd reconsidered, and ask for their job back.

Boss was ALWAYS understanding and took them back, but very carefully noted the 10 to 15 minute break in their employment, to show that the company remained in compliance.

Aftermath:  We had contests to see who could have the most dramatic ""I quit"" scene.

Medicaid noted our activities, but couldn't put a handle on how to stop it.

2294,Neighbor tells Gramps he should “mind his own damn business”. That advice costs neighbor most of his yard and a car.,33413,"Gramps had just moved into a retirement park with a lot that backed up to county land that was a nature preserve. His backyard was basically non-existent, but he didn’t mind as he got to look out over the preserve, however he did marvel at how his next door neighbor’s backyard extended a good 8ft past his, giving neighbor a nice space back there. 

Gramps tried to be friendly with all his new neighbors, exchanging phone numbers and the like, and one day he noticed the next door neighbor was putting down expensive pavers that extended from his back door all the way to the old fence posts that designated the preserve boundary. Gramps watched the neighbor yank the three rickety fence posts out of the ground and move them back an extra two feet into the preserve before pounding them back in, then started to clear the land, intending to gain himself more area for his pavers. Gramps used to work for the national park services as a young lad, so he thought he had better warn his neighbor of the consequences of his actions, so he heads out back for a little chat. Neighbor is immediately defensive and before Gramps says much, neighbor tells him “you’re new here, I’ve been here 10 years” and to “mind your own damn business.” Gramps decides not to press the issue.

Nothing happens that year, but the following year when most of the park emptied out to head north for the summer the county comes by to check on the preserve. Gramps notices them going back and forth behind his neighbor’s house, the workers are pulling out maps and taking photos and making phone calls and soon more guys show up. Turns out neighbor has moved the posts several times over the years, and in reality his backyard is supposed to be even smaller than Gramp’s backyard! To make it worse, neighbor put pavers in the back specifically to park both his golf cart AND a cherry red sports car back there for the summer, so the county will have to move them before they can do anything else. They tape a notice to the front door and leave. 

Gramps goes over to read it, and it states that neighbor was in violation of encroaching onto protected lands, he has 30 days to move his car, tear up the pavers and pay a fine of $11,000 (because of damage to endangered species who inhabit the protected lands, as well as trespassing fees). Failure to do so within 30 days will result in golf cart & car being towed and impounded, pavers will be dug up and carted off at neighbor’s expense and the fine will increased for every additional day past the deadline. 

30 days comes and goes, so a week after that Gramps has quite the show as first the car and cart were towed, pavers were dug up and hauled off, and the old fence posts and ropes were replaced with metal posts embedded into buried cement bases, connected by steel cables. Whole process took several weeks to finish, but the preserve looked a lot more legit when they were done. A few solar cameras were installed so the county could monitor the wildlife (and encroachers) remotely, meanwhile more notices were taped to the front door of neighbor’s house.

By November the snowbirds were flooding back into the park, including neighbor. That was Gramps’ 2nd show of the summer as neighbor reads all the notices, digging down until he reads the first one, then runs out back and starts screaming and cussing up a storm before running back to his car to dig out his cell phone so he can call the county to find out where his car and golf cart were. Gramps stays indoors to avoid the guy as he is frantically trying to unload his car, turn on his water and electricity, get the ac and the toilets going, and all the while trying to get someone at county to pick up the phone and give him some answers. He finally gets a live person and proceeds to scream at them while on speakerphone about his car and cart, so the call keeps getting kicked to other people because who wants to help a screamer? Basically neighbor is told to come to the county office to get this straightened out.

Three days later neighbor catches Gramps outside and asks if he was here when the county “stole his car and destroyed his backyard”. Gramps said he was, and neighbor says “well why didn’t you call me when you saw them putting notices on my door? You had my number up north!” Gramps said he had thought about doing that, but figured neighbor would prefer him to “mind his own damn business”, so he decided against it.",False,MaliciousCompliance
2295,"Bank won't make change, I close my account instead",33146,"This happened a few years ago, I was working at a large national chain restaurant as a Manager.   I was asked to temporarily re-assign to a location in a city about an hour away, and accepted...they put me up in a hotel, the whole 9 yards.   

The first weekend I was there, I discovered that the GM had screwed up and not ordered any change (small bills/rolls of coins) for the safe, and that the local branch of our bank would be closing in the next hour.   I also happened to have a personal account at the same bank, and had, in the past, gone and gotten change from the branch back home.

Since time was tight, I quickly looked up the address of the bank, grabbed $800 dollars, and jumped in my car.   I get to the bank, wait in line, and then ask them to make change ($400 in $5 bills, $300 in $1 bills, and $100 in assorted rolled coins).   The teller tells me that the bank doesn't make change.   Me, thinking it was because they didn't know me, informed her that our restaurant had an account she could look up.   She then told me, ""No, we don't make change at all.""    The thought going through my brain was, ""WTF? You are a BANK!!!""   I tried explaining the situation, but was quickly shot down.   I left, went back to my car, then had an idea.   

I went back inside the bank with my personal checkbook.   Got to the front of the line, and (luckily) the same teller.   Before she could even greet me, I told held out my checkbook and told her, ""I would like to close this account, since this bank is no longer customer service oriented"".   She kind of rolled her eyes, but went about my request.   Then she asked how I wanted my cash back (an automatic response, I'm sure, and one I was counting on).    I said, ""$400 in $5's, $300 in $1's, $70 in rolled quarters, $25 in rolled dimes, $4 in rolled nickels, and $1 in rolled pennies.    The rest can be on a cashier's check.""   No reason for her to deny it, so I got my change.


And the following Monday, I returned, closed out the other 2 accounts I had there, and I opened accounts at a different bank where I have been banking ever since.


EDIT:   So, wow, never saw this exploding this much....I have only read a few comments and won't be back online until tomorrow to read the rest, but let me clarify something from the comments I did read... I did not open or close any accounts for the business.    I closed my personal account and took the payout in small change to help the restaurant, then kept the larger bills for myself.    In essence, I made myself into the bank...I made change for the restaurant.   On Monday, I closed all of my personal accounts with this bank, and opened new accounts at a different bank, and deposited the $800 in large bills along with the money from my accounts.    Also:   this was 15 years ago, so banking at the time was not all done on a Smartphone, and none of my bills were autopay, I still wrote checks.

2350,[UPDATE] I'm [28F] unsure if it's time to draw boundaries with my boyfriend [28M] and his coworker [late 20sF] who he got close to very quickly,14491,"Original post is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im\_28f\_unsure\_if\_its\_time\_to\_draw\_boundaries\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cx874/im_28f_unsure_if_its_time_to_draw_boundaries_with/)

TLDR of original: My boyfriend has become fast friends with a female coworker. She and her fiancé are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.

&#x200B;

A lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!

After I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.

He set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Finally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!

It turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.

So communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!

EDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule 😭 And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?!

2351,UPDATE: I (24F) have a crush on a guy (29M) at my grad school. I’ve been with my fiancé (25M) for 5 years. How do I get rid of the crush?,11471,"Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d9xc55/i_24f_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_29m_at_my_grad_school/).

Thanks for all your advice (except for everyone who gave me abuse or told me to just fuck the guy I had a crush on)! I was worried the crush would stay, most people in the comments said it would go away, and I guess you were right.

I talked to my fiancé about it and when we were talking we realized I've been staying at school to study every evening and haven't been making much time for him. I leave school before 6pm now so I get home when he does after he's been to work and we're spending quality time together every day, which is making us closer and helping me remember all the great things that our relationship has.

I also talked to Will (a lot of you suggested that if I got to know him the crush would go away). I didn't tell him about the crush. I just made a friend. We're...very different. It would never work. I basically had 3 conversations with him and the crush died. He is fun to gaze at but we wouldn't even be together if we were both single (turns out he's engaged as well, go figure) and I don't have feelings for him anymore.

tl;dr - Will is out, Chris is in",False,relationships
2352,"[UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship",11127,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  


So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. 

I started by saying: ""So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?""

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. 

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. 

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. 

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. 

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an ""issue"" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. 

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. 

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. 

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. 

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. 

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. 

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.

2353,"[UPDATE]My [26 F] with my husband [29 M] 1 year, he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, how to make it count?",10998,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dheie/my_26_f_with_my_husband_29_m_1_year_he_has_been/)

Summary of Original Post- My husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After failure of chemo and other treatments, he was told he has about a month to live. I asked for advice on how to make this time count and all of you wonderful people gave some very good advice.


Let me begin by saying that as much as I was day dreaming that I'll get to update everyone of a miraculous recovery my brave darling made, I had to wake up to the bitter reality. My husband passed away a few days ago. And just as a lot of you had warned me, with all the preparation in the world and a warning that not many are fortunate to receive, absolutely nothing about when it actually happened felt like I was at all ready. It may as easily have been sudden. He fought bravely to the end and I'm proud of his attitude. I'm happy he doesn't have to suffer and put on a brave face for me anymore.

I'm here to thank all of you. Despite what I said above about not feeling prepared, I do feel blessed for having got that time. We may not have completely finished ""the list"" but we sure got to do some of the things that the busy preoccupations of life in all its cruelty snatches from a lot of people. We may not be completely without regrets but we managed to make our list of 'I wish I had's a lot shorter than it would have been before the warning. So here I am to thank everyone who commented/replied/PMed on that post. It meant a lot to both of us. A sincere thanks to all of you.

A special shout to a few people:
u/mistyranch for courage and sharing 
u/mcdie88 for making me feel like a 100 years old (covered that milestone too as he insisted I will live his share too!)
u/tacofugitive for looking out for me
u/aaoun responsible for some high quality home made porn
u/dahlialia who irritated the hell out of my husband as I wanted answers to ALL the questions
u/emalen thanks to whom I thought about this part, the coping
u/whatsleftisrigh for instilling some pragmatism in me
u/ianoftawa thanks to whom unfinished business won't be an issue
u/brandyelf who made X'mas come early this year
u/tenebrous1 who inspired a letter that I haven't been able to read past two lines of
u/emlgsh whose words rung in my ears to keep me stronger on the bad days
u/throwyourtoothbrush without whose advice I would have tried to do it all on my own and made a mess for sure
u/tomyownrhythm who sure knows how to turn a good spin on the dark moments
u/daivyjones for the immense support
u/WeltallPrime for inspiring my very first novel
and so many others for all the wonderful advice, support and most importantly for sharing your stories, I can't thank you enough. I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me.

Here's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):
1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself.
2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my ""next spouse"" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. 
3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book.
4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready!
5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want.
6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together.
7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex
8. Speaking of which, lots of sex. 
9. We discussed with his doctors and freezing his sperm was not a possibility at this stage so that couldn't pan out. 
10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary
11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor.
12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other.
13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message 
14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer.
15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time.
16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his
17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with
   
I feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last month. The quote about living each day like your last got realized. I made a lot of memories I'll never forget. 

I want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless.

In the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world.

Thank you all once again. 

**tl;dr**: My husband passed away, this update is to thank all of you for your wonderful advice and support

Edit 1 : Thank you once again Reddit, for all the overwhelming response. Thanks for all the tears, all the hugs and all the support. Thanks for the PMs offering more support. And above all, thanks for our story helped make a difference in your life. I'm so grateful to each of you who's vowed to work on their relationships and love their partners more. I'm trying to reply to each one of you kindhearted folks, apologies if I have missed out on anyone. Thank you for being with me in this time. Your thoughts, prayers and support means a lot to me.

Soon after I made the post, my husband called me. He was babbling and I couldn't understand him, so I kept asking him to slow down. Then he started screaming (not yelling, literally just screaming). I freaked out because I thought he was being murdered or something. I tracked his phone to a park in town and called 911.

Turns out he had a complete mental breakdown. He's in the process of being diagnosed with a mental illness that usually shows up in people's 20s but for some reason manifested later in him. He's currently in an inpatient mental health program and already doing a lot better.

Thank you all again for the responses and advice on my original post.

2355,"[UPDATE] I [29F] am traveling overseas to meet my online ""boyfriend"" [38M] in a week.

After my post I FaceTimed him to say my what I wanted to say and end things. He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call. 

I went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;

I learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This ""relationship"" was my first ""serious"" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely. 

My first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had. 

Thank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!

2356,My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update],10000,"Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now. 

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog.",False,relationships
2357,Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months,9854,"Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, ""deluding herself into thinking she's actually home"", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of *someone* in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

2358,[UPDATE] My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.,9387,"The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9du198/my_best_friend_20m_asked_me_20m_out_i_said_yes_i/

First of all, I wanted to thank people for responding. I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.

Next, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.

I gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.

Noah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P

One of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.

About a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.

That was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.

I'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.

It sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.

TL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.

2359,"UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to ""unlove"" the men from my past before I can love him.",9299,"Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my\_24\_f\_boyfriend\_26\_m\_of\_6\_months\_told\_me\_that\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ccl1gt/my_24_f_boyfriend_26_m_of_6_months_told_me_that_i/)

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to ""command"" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!",False,relationships
2360,(Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?,9168,"[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. 

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. 

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. 

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you!

I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down.

2362,"[UPDATE] Me [32/F] with my husband [39 M] 6-years, our sex life disappeared; he swears he's attracted to me and I'm not sure what to believe or do.",8633,"[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)

I know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).

Through interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  

1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.

2.  He see someone psychologically.

3.  Couple's counseling.

I decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.

He took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  

And then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.

A few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.

I headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.

I drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  

She left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.

So I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.

I worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.

More recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.

On the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.

I started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.

So I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).

I decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.

I had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.

So when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.

But nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt ""forced"" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.

He then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  

I think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  

I should have listened to my gut all along.

We had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    

I don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.

Overall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.

And thank you everyone for all your help.

2363,"UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now",8553,"Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief. 

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out. 

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad. 

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great. 

 Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).",False,relationships
2364,Update: My [25f] boyfriend [26m] of 10 months is best friends with his ex [20s?f]. She refuses to meet me and it's getting weird,8546,"Link to OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mql7n/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_of_10_months_is_best_friends/


I wrote my previous post over a year ago, and a lot has happened since then. I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.



For a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.



Things got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.



While I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship. 





I didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.




As of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.

I wanted to give an update on this post I wrote about 2 years ago. I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding. 

Well, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates. 

The first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't. 

I later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything. 

Well he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, ""Are you going to marry me or not?"" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October. 

I've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together!

2367,UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me & I don't know how to handle this.,7993,"Link to original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z9cgn/i_26f_opened_my_husbands_32m_snapchat_and_it_was/?ref=search_posts

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.

So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.""

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else.

**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

**I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.**

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

**If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.**

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.

EDIT: for those saying it didn’t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year.

2369,[Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.,7643,"OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, ""Well did you want to? My lease is up in July."" and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!

**Edit:** Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.

Many people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)",False,relationships
2370,Girlfriend (25 f) dislikes my (30 m ) relationship with my baby sister (10 f),7451,"I am very close to my baby sister. We share a father, but not a mother. My dad, is kinda a flighty guy. As a result, I’m more of my sister’s dad than he is. I have her so often that I have a two bedroom condo and every house hunting venture lately considers her.

My girlfriend of six months doesn’t like that she’s always at my house, that she has a room, or that I do her laundry. My girlfriend was putting sheets on my bed and there was a pair of my sister’s underwear that fell out of them obviously tangled in the dryer. She lost it. She was saying our relationship is weird and I have to stop having my sister so much. Honestly, that’s not gonna happen. I love that girl, and I’m basically her dad. So I need advice in telling my probably soon to be ex that.

Tl;dr girlfriend is jealous of the time I spend with my little sister and basically insinuates it’s inappropriate. How do I tell her to chill? More importantly, how do I keep her from telling other people that?

Edit: we did sort of fight when she said that. I told her my sister is the age I was when my mom died and I had to go live with my dad full time. I wouldn’t wish that on any child. She knows my mom died horribly and I think she knows the impact it’s had on me

2371,Update: I [30 F] am sitting in the back of my RV as my husband [32 M] rants about how lovely the trip would be if I hadn't joined him.,7450,"[My first post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ecgbv/i_30_f_am_sitting_in_the_back_of_my_rv_as_my/) The TLDR of the first post is that I bought an RV with my money so I could write/travel in it while husband is away for business. Husband insisted on taking the RV with him without me, I convinced him to let me come. Now he is ranting about how he doesn't want me on the trip while I sit in the back of the RV hating my life.

I promised I would update, but things got very hectic and this is the first chance I have gotten. This whole situation makes me very emotional, so please forgive me if this post is not as coherent as I would like it to be.

When I posted my first post, we were on the road in the RV and my husband was giving me the cold shoulder while he bitched at me from the driver's seat. You all had some great advice for me about what I should do, and I listened to a few people who suggested that he might be cheating on me.

Tim had left his iPad in the back of the RV to charge while he drove. I'm not proud of this, but I was able to sneak his iPad into the bedroom while he was distracted by the road. He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn't find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: ""I can't wait to get my hands on you! It's been years since I felt that mouth. I'm excited!"" 

I was disgusted, but I tried to keep calm. We were on the road headed to another state and we planned on stopping at his mother's house. I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don't worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason. I smiled and nodded but on the inside I was cursing his existence.

We made it to his mom's house and I made up an excuse about having to change because my clothes were wrinkled. Tim went inside without me and I started throwing all of his clothes and belongings into a trashbag. I then went inside the house and Tim was sitting with his mom in the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, ""I'm not sure myself. I'm waiting for Tim to explain why he was planning to cheat on me with his ex.""

Tim's mom then started to cry and yell at Tim while he tried to calm her down. I know Reddit does not have a lot of love for religion, but Tim's mother is a fundamentalist. She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn't even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband.

Tim called me the next day and begged me to come back to him. He said it was all a mistake, that he was sorry. I asked him why he didn't apologize at his mother's house, why he didn't say he was sorry when I was handing him his bag. I told him that he didn't care about cheating on me, that all he cared about was how bad it made him look to his family. He tried to explain himself, but I cut him off and hung up. I blocked him on all social media and haven't heard anything since. 

I have gotten a lawyer and have already started the divorce process.

2372,Update: How do I [26F] tell my husband [31M] I'm addicted to drugs?,7410,"[Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cjph9/how_do_i_26f_tell_my_husband_31m_im_addicted_to/)

I've been sober since May 22, 2017 :)

It's been almost a year and a half since I posted, I was a mess that day and really overwhelmed. You all gave me the push I needed to gather my courage and tell my husband about my drug use, **thank you so much for that**. I mean it, I knew he needed to know but I couldn't make myself follow through until I received encouragement a bunch of internet strangers. I hate to think what might have happened had I continued hiding it from him.

My husband has been supportive, compassionate, and kind throughout my recovery. I wouldn't be doing so well today without him, there aren't words to express how much I love him and how grateful I am to be married to such a good man. With the help of my therapist I was able to open up to him about being raped (it was a violent, ugly, all around horrible incident) and the effect PTSD has had on me (it's an explanation, not an excuse, for the drug use). 

We've had to work on rebuilding trust and I realize that's going to take time. He still prefers I stay home most of the time and he has reservations about new friends- both are totally reasonable in my opinion. I understand his feelings completely. We do more together now and I feel more included in his life, which has really helped my mental health. Every day I do my best to prove my love, appreciation, and respect for him. We're both continually putting effort into ourselves and our marriage.

As for my recovery, I honestly feel a little weird calling it that. I didn't use long term and didn't face many of the same challenges as other addicts. But I am an addict, I'm always aware of that and I realize I'm no different fundamentally from someone doing heroin on the streets.

Drugs were a distraction and a way to escape bad memories and nightmares. They were also part of my social life as my only friend in the area (at that time) used them too. Once I accepted that I had, and will always have, PTSD and began getting proper treatment I didn't want anything to do with drugs. I'm extremely lucky and thankful I stopped when I did.

Dealing with my mental health hasn't been easy. Last August I went to a behavioral health hospital for six days. I didn't want to go at first but my husband and therapist convinced me I needed to- they were right. I felt much better afterward and I met a few people like me while I was there, it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone. People can say that you aren't alone all the time but it's different when you actually experience it.

My husband and I went to couples' therapy for 3 months. It helped us quite a bit, we realized we needed to talk about things that hadn't occurred to either of us before sitting down with a therapist. It helped me understand his feelings and how my drug use (and concealing it from him) affected him. It helped him understand why I did what I did. It gave us a safe place to talk and that eventually led to better communication in private.

I'm still seeing a therapist twice a month and attend group therapy once a month. I'm stable, healthy, and happy. I love my life and I'm really excited about the future. We're expecting a baby in the Spring and I can't wait to be a mom. I'm so looking forward to raising a family with my husband. Life is good. :) Thanks again, /r/relationships 

**TL;DR**: I've been sober since May 22, 2017. My husband and I are doing well, we're happy and very much in love. He's supported me and loved me through this process. We've had a few struggles along the way but we work through things as they come up and move forward. I'm continuing to receive treatment for my mental health and I feel stronger than I ever have. I've learned I can't hide from my problems and now that I've received the appropriate treatment for PTSD I don't want to hide from it anymore. I'm finally happy and excited about my life and my future.",False,relationships
2373,UPDATE: My fiancee (24F) has no bridesmaids and it's making her so upset she wants to call off the wedding. How can I (25m) help?,7341,"OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3am0dc/my_fianc%C3%A9e_24f_has_no_bridesmaids_and_its_making/?sort=new

Did not expect to update this fast.  Did not expect to update at all, unless something miraculous happened.  And it did.

In short, I have the best friends in the world.

I read through a ton of these comments, but not all (over 1000?!)  and decided to look for my fiance's box of wedding planning stuff, because I had a suspicion.  Inside the box was all these magazine clippings of a big church wedding, flower ideas and stuff.  And then I saw pictures of the dresses.  They were all big, poofy ornate things that don't seem akin to my fiancee's style at all.  But...they're similar to the dresses my sisters wore at their weddings.

It all sort of clicked for me.  My fiancee probably doesn't want a church wedding or any of these fancy trimmings, she's trying to win my family's favor.  The hell.  I really should've noticed this earlier and gotten more involved, I know.

My fiancee flew home on Thursday to spend a few days with her dad (Father's Day weekend and all).  I couldn't go because of work, so I was alone until this morning.  So, real late at night, I called up my buddy Ravi (26M).  Ravi's my best man, we've known each other since we were kids, split up when we went off to college, and reconnected three years ago.  We moved to SC so I could join the company he works for. 

I just opened up to Ravi.  It was really late but he listened to me anyway, about my worries about my fiancee.  He said that it was very likely that she was trying to curry favor with my family, but she probably wasn't going to admit to it easily.  He said he'd talk to her.

I told him that he barely knows her.  He said not to worry, and that he'd be around tomorrow evening.

My fiancee came home happy (she always is after seeing her dad) this morning.  I went off to work without asking about the wedding, and she set to work on her writing (she's off for the summer).  I got home early and at like 5 PM Ravi came to my house with my other good friends: Carson, Andrew, and Tim (23-30M).  I know all these guys from various places and we're all a solid group.  Still, this was unexpected.

Ravi came up to my fiancee and said that the guys were taking her wedding dress shopping.

We were both freaked out as hell.  I had no idea this was coming, and my fiancee looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  She whispered to me ""they won't like me"", and I urged her to just go for it.  Ravi reminded her that he has sisters, Carson's been divorced, and Andrew's had his fair share of girlfriends, so they know dresses.  Plus, he has a lady friend that works at a small boutique, where they'd try first.

She still didn't want to go, and then he said something like ""hey, you're marrying our best friend, don't you think we should get to know you and make sure you're not a ghost or something?""  (He's not great with tact).  But she chuckled a little at that and gave in.

They were gone for a while and came back an hour ago.  They didn't find a dress, but they looked around the stores for a while and fiancee found a style she liked (not the poofy ball gown style).  They also went out for ice cream and when they walked in the door, she was joking and laughing with them all.  I hadn't seen her so happy in a long time.  It was amazing.

Then we all sat down together and Ravi asked her to talk to me about what's on her mind.

I still don't know how they got her to open up.  She whispered that she didn't really want the big church wedding, that she wanted to wait a little while and plan a small ceremony for just the people we really care about.  I was all for it, I told her not to worry about bridesmaids or anything, it could just be us.  She said no, she wants her dad, the guys, and my family to be there.  

Andrew, a kickass guitar player, said he'd put together a band for us.  He asked my fiancee what her favorite song is, he'd figure out an arrangement.  This is the kind of question she usually dodges, but she blushed a little and actually told the truth.  (Panama by Van Halen if anyone cares; girl knows how to rock out).  This was the real sign that she's starting to trust them.  I don't think anyone knows her favorite song except me and her dad (who bought her Van Halen CD's growing up)

I told her I'd call my family and tell them the church wedding's off.  If they make a big stink about it, I don't fucking care.  I have my bros and my beautiful future bride.  That's all the family I need.

2374,"UPDATE: Every year, my boyfriend (21M) and I (22F) go on a “break” because he doesn’t know what he wants",7044,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/88bexu/every_year_my_boyfriend_21m_and_i_22f_go_on_a/?st=JJAFPS2E&sh=4755fc51

It’s been about 4 months since my first post and I thought I’d post an update.

Looking back on this post, I can’t believe what a difference 4 months has made. After posting it, I read my own words and realized that the relationship was over. I was making excuses for him and justifying staying miserable in the relationship because I just loved him so much. 

We had a talk when I visited my hometown and broke up. We both were emotional but knew it was  for the best, and I was content thinking we were going to spend time being single and discovering who we are as individuals after being so close for so long. 

Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. I found out he had been cheating for at least a couple months before telling me he wanted another break. He began officially dating the new girl about 3 days after we broke up and he moved in with her after a couple months of dating. He has always been super resistant to commitments before, so that came as a shock. My self esteem took a huge hit. 

Now things are different. I discover new things about myself every day, I spend time with my friends who make me feel loved and important, and I’m truly happy for the first time in a long time. At first I wanted to start dating again and I told myself I was ready, but the truth is that there’s so much I don’t know about myself yet, and I want to get to know me before I focus on another relationship. 

Anyway, thank you to the people who commented and let me know that something was going on. As obvious as it was to them, I was completely blindsided. I’m just grateful to be out of that situation and I’m excited for what’s ahead.

2445,WARNING: Do *not* skin your Nintendo Switch!,39290,"Hey Reddit,

dbrand here. Exciting day, right? You’re probably running low on battery after a third charge cycle, working on collecting the fourth spirit orb. What a time to be alive! Enough with the small talk though, let’s jump into this.

We’re here to make a public service announcement that **under no circumstances** should you be buying a vinyl skin / wrap for your Nintendo Switch. Seems like a counter-intuitive narrative from the world’s leading skin manufacturer, right? Allow us to explain. 

Simply put, the coating which exists on the JoyCons (and the console – more on that later) is either cured or designed in a way which doesn’t play well with adhesive. 

We received the Switch about 96 hours ago and immediately began prototyping. After a couple of prototypes, we saw minor indications of the outer coating beginning to peel off. Nintendo advised that the device we had in-hand was not the final build, although we assumed that pertained more to the software than the hardware.

We continued prototyping and after about 24 hours of applying and removing prototypes, the JoyCons looked like this - **[image link](http://i.imgur.com/SmD0RcV.jpg)**. At this point, we hit pause on the JoyCons and continued onto the console. 

We decided to reserve judgement on whether the JoyCons could be skinned until we purchased a normal unit, like humans do, on release day from a physical retail location. If we found that a retail unit had similar peeling issues, a fact we can now confirm to be true, we would not release skins for the JoyCons.

Unfortunately, our prototyping phase with the pre-release console had another (albeit different) issue with vinyl skin incompatibility. If you look at the back of the Switch, you’ll see that the Nintendo Switch logo and regulatory markings are all screen-printed in a light gray. This screen-printing (or pad-printing) process is also cured in a way which peels off with the adhesive on vinyl wraps. To get a clear understanding of what we mean, take a look at this photo - **[image link](http://i.imgur.com/iOPPHYU.jpg)** of the back of the console.

Again, we decided to reserve judgement on whether the Console would be skin-able until we purchased a retail unit to compare against the potentially non-final early unit which we were prototyping with.

As you can guess, we purchased a retail unit (ten, in fact… just to make sure it wasn’t an isolated issue) and both the JoyCons and the Console are **not compatible with vinyl wraps or any adhesive-backed skin of any kind**.

This is really quite unfortunate, not just because we were going to make a ton of money from this console, but more-so because it genuinely did look dope with a skin (check it out in Matte White here - **[image link](http://i.imgur.com/ENnGgMh.jpg)**).

As for anyone who pre-ordered a Switch skin, we’ll be refunding your order in full over the next 72 hours. Upon execution, you can expect an email from our customer service robots confirming that the refund has been processed. If you pre-ordered a Switch skin alongside other item(s), you’ll receive a refund for only the Switch portion and the remaining pieces will ship normally. 

If you have any further questions, feel free to post up. If it’s a specific question regarding your order, the *absolute most efficient way* to receive a reply is by emailing robots@dbrand.com. Public replies require identity verification that is better served in a private setting, and PMs will end up getting manually transferred over to an email ticket regardless. We’re not bullshitting when we say that our customer service desk is the very best way to get any issues resolved efficiently.

Thanks in advance for your support and enjoy your Switch ^^^…as ^^^much ^^^as ^^^you ^^^can ^^^without ^^^a ^^^dbrand ^^^skin.",False,NintendoSwitch
